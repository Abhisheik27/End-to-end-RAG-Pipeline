Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nP E(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nP E(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, P Epos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nP Epos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈ Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations.

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7'),\n",

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Users specify a map function that processes a\\nkey/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value\\npairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate\\nvalues associated with the same intermediate key. Many\\nreal world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown\\nin the paper.\\nPrograms written in this functional style are automati-\\ncally parallelized and executed on a large cluster of com-\\nmodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the\\ndetails of partitioning the input data, scheduling the pro-\\ngram's execution across a set of machines, handling ma-\\nchine failures, and managing the required inter-machine\\ncommunication. This allows programmers without any\\nexperience with parallel and distributed systems to eas-\\nily utilize the resources of a large distributed system.\\nOur implementation of MapReduce runs on a large\\ncluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable:\\na typical MapReduce computation processes many ter-\\nabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers\\n\\x02nd the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce pro-\\ngrams have been implemented and upwards of one thou-\\nsand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google's clusters\\nevery day.\\n1 Introduction\\nOver the past \\x02ve years, the authors and many others at\\nGoogle have implemented hundreds of special-purpose\\ncomputations that process large amounts of raw data,\\nsuch as crawled documents, web request logs, etc., to\\ncompute various kinds of derived data, such as inverted\\nindices, various representations of the graph structure\\nof web documents, summaries of the number of pages\\ncrawled per host, the set of most frequent queries in a\\ngiven day, etc. Most such computations are conceptu-\\nally straightforward. However, the input data is usually\\nlarge and the computations have to be distributed across\\nhundreds or thousands of machines in order to \\x02nish in\\na reasonable amount of time. The issues of how to par-\\nallelize the computation, distribute the data, and handle\\nfailures conspire to obscure the original simple compu-\\ntation with large amounts of complex code to deal with\\nthese issues.\\nAs a reaction to this complexity, we designed a new\\nabstraction that allows us to express the simple computa-\\ntions we were trying to perform but hides the messy de-\\ntails of parallelization, fault-tolerance, data distribution\\nand load balancing in a library. Our abstraction is in-\\nspired by the map and reduce primitives present in Lisp\\nand many other functional languages. We realized that\\nmost of our computations involved applying a map op-\\neration to each logical \\x93record\\x94 in our input in order to\\ncompute a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and then\\napplying a reduce operation to all the values that shared\\nthe same key, in order to combine the derived data ap-\\npropriately. Our use of a functional model with user-\\nspeci\\x02ed map and reduce operations allows us to paral-\\nlelize large computations easily and to use re-execution\\nas the primary mechanism for fault tolerance.\\nThe major contributions of this work are a simple and\\npowerful interface that enables automatic parallelization\\nand distribution of large-scale computations, combined\\nwith an implementation of this interface that achieves\\nhigh performance on large clusters of commodity PCs.\\nSection 2 describes the basic programming model and\\ngives several examples. Section 3 describes an imple-\\nmentation of the MapReduce interface tailored towards\\nour cluster-based computing environment. Section 4 de-\\nscribes several re\\x02nements of the programming model\\nthat we have found useful. Section 5 has performance\\nmeasurements of our implementation for a variety of\\ntasks.

Sec-\\ntion 7 discusses related and future work.\\n2 Programming Model\\nThe computation takes a set of input key/value pairs, and\\nproduces a set of output key/value pairs. The user of\\nthe MapReduce library expresses the computation as two\\nfunctions: Map and Reduce.\\nMap, written by the user, takes an input pair and pro-\\nduces a set of intermediate key/value pairs. The MapRe-\\nduce library groups together all intermediate values asso-\\nciated with the same intermediate key I and passes them\\nto the Reduce function.\\nThe Reduce function, also written by the user, accepts\\nan intermediate key I and a set of values for that key. It\\nmerges together these values to form a possibly smaller\\nset of values. Typically just zero or one output value is\\nproduced per Reduce invocation. The intermediate val-\\nues are supplied to the user\\'s reduce function via an iter-\\nator. This allows us to handle lists of values that are too\\nlarge to \\x02t in memory.\\n2.1 Example\\nConsider the problem of counting the number of oc-\\ncurrences of each word in a large collection of docu-\\nments. The user would write code similar to the follow-\\ning pseudo-code:\\nmap(String key, String value):\\n// key: document name\\n// value: document contents\\nfor each word w in value:\\nEmitIntermediate(w, \"1\");\\nreduce(String key, Iterator values):\\n// key: a word\\n// values: a list of counts\\nint result = 0;\\nfor each v in values:\\nresult += ParseInt(v);\\nEmit(AsString(result));\\nThe mapfunction emits each word plus an associated\\ncount of occurrences (just `1\\' in this simple example).\\nThe reducefunction sums together all counts emitted\\nfor a particular word.\\nIn addition, the user writes code to \\x02ll in a mapreduce\\nspeci\\x02cation object with the names of the input and out-\\nput \\x02les, and optional tuning parameters. The user then\\ninvokes the MapReduce function, passing it the speci\\x02-\\ncation object. The user\\'s code is linked together with the\\nMapReduce library (implemented in C++). Appendix A\\ncontains the full program text for this example.\\n2.2 Types\\nEven though the previous pseudo-code is written in terms\\nof string inputs and outputs, conceptually the map and\\nreduce functions supplied by the user have associated\\ntypes:\\nmap (k1,v1) ! list(k2,v2)\\nreduce (k2,list(v2)) ! list(v2)\\nI.e., the input keys and values are drawn from a different\\ndomain than the output keys and values. Furthermore,\\nthe intermediate keys and values are from the same do-\\nmain as the output keys and values.\\nOur C++ implementation passes strings to and from\\nthe user-de\\x02ned functions and leaves it to the user code\\nto convert between strings and appropriate types.\\n2.3 More Examples\\nHere are a few simple examples of interesting programs\\nthat can be easily expressed as MapReduce computa-\\ntions.\\nDistributed Grep: The map function emits a line if it\\nmatches a supplied pattern. The reduce function is an\\nidentity function that just copies the supplied intermedi-\\nate data to the output.\\nCount of URL Access Frequency: The map func-\\ntion processes logs of web page requests and outputs\\nhURL; 1i. The reduce function adds together all values\\nfor the same URL and emits a hURL; total counti\\npair.\\nReverse Web-Link Graph: The map function outputs\\nhtarget; sourcei pairs for each link to a target\\nURL found in a page named source. The reduce\\nfunction concatenates the list of all source URLs as-\\nsociated with a given target URL and emits the pair:\\nhtarget; list(source)i\\nTerm-Vector per Host: A term vector summarizes the\\nmost important words that occur in a document or a set\\nof documents as a list of hword; f requencyi pairs. The\\nmap function emits a hhostname; term vectori\\npair for each input document (where the hostname is\\nextracted from the URL of the document). The re-\\nduce function is passed all per-document term vectors\\nfor a given host. It adds these term vectors together,\\nthrowing away infrequent terms, and then emits a \\x02nal\\nhhostname; term vectori pair.\\nTo appear in OSDI 2004 2'),\n",

The input splits can be pro-\\ncessed in parallel by different machines. Reduce invoca-\\ntions are distributed by partitioning the intermediate key\\nspace into R pieces using a partitioning function (e.g.,\\nhash(key) mod R). The number of partitions (R) and\\nthe partitioning function are speci\\x02ed by the user.\\nFigure 1 shows the overall \\x03ow of a MapReduce op-\\neration in our implementation. When the user program\\ncalls the MapReducefunction, the following sequence\\nof actions occurs (the numbered labels in Figure 1 corre-\\nspond to the numbers in the list below):\\n1. The MapReduce library in the user program \\x02rst\\nsplits the input \\x02les into M pieces of typically 16\\nmegabytes to 64 megabytes (MB) per piece (con-\\ntrollable by the user via an optional parameter). It\\nthen starts up many copies of the program on a clus-\\nter of machines.\\n2. One of the copies of the program is special \\x96 the\\nmaster. The rest are workers that are assigned work\\nby the master. There are M map tasks and R reduce\\ntasks to assign. The master picks idle workers and\\nassigns each one a map task or a reduce task.\\n3. A worker who is assigned a map task reads the\\ncontents of the corresponding input split. It parses\\nkey/value pairs out of the input data and passes each\\npair to the user-de\\x02ned Map function. The interme-\\ndiate key/value pairs produced by the Map function\\nare buffered in memory.\\n4. Periodically, the buffered pairs are written to local\\ndisk, partitioned into R regions by the partitioning\\nfunction. The locations of these buffered pairs on\\nthe local disk are passed back to the master, who\\nis responsible for forwarding these locations to the\\nreduce workers.\\n5. When a reduce worker is noti\\x02ed by the master\\nabout these locations, it uses remote procedure calls\\nto read the buffered data from the local disks of the\\nmap workers. When a reduce worker has read all in-\\ntermediate data, it sorts it by the intermediate keys\\nso that all occurrences of the same key are grouped\\ntogether. The sorting is needed because typically\\nmany different keys map to the same reduce task. If\\nthe amount of intermediate data is too large to \\x02t in\\nmemory, an external sort is used.\\n6. The reduce worker iterates over the sorted interme-\\ndiate data and for each unique intermediate key en-\\ncountered, it passes the key and the corresponding\\nset of intermediate values to the user's Reduce func-\\ntion. The output of the Reduce function is appended\\nto a \\x02nal output \\x02le for this reduce partition.\\n7. When all map tasks and reduce tasks have been\\ncompleted, the master wakes up the user program.\\nAt this point, the MapReducecall in the user pro-\\ngram returns back to the user code.\\nAfter successful completion, the output of the mapre-\\nduce execution is available in the R output \\x02les (one per\\nreduce task, with \\x02le names as speci\\x02ed by the user).\\nTypically, users do not need to combine these R output\\n\\x02les into one \\x02le \\x96 they often pass these \\x02les as input to\\nanother MapReduce call, or use them from another dis-\\ntributed application that is able to deal with input that is\\npartitioned into multiple \\x02les.\\n3.2 Master Data Structures\\nThe master keeps several data structures. For each map\\ntask and reduce task, it stores the state (idle, in-progress,\\nor completed), and the identity of the worker machine\\n(for non-idle tasks).\\nThe master is the conduit through which the location\\nof intermediate \\x02le regions is propagated from map tasks\\nto reduce tasks. Therefore, for each completed map task,\\nthe master stores the locations and sizes of the R inter-\\nmediate \\x02le regions produced by the map task. Updates\\nto this location and size information are received as map\\ntasks are completed. The information is pushed incre-\\nmentally to workers that have in-progress reduce tasks.\\n3.3 Fault Tolerance\\nSince the MapReduce library is designed to help process\\nvery large amounts of data using hundreds or thousands\\nof machines, the library must tolerate machine failures\\ngracefully.\\nWorker Failure\\nThe master pings every worker periodically. If no re-\\nsponse is received from a worker in a certain amount of\\ntime, the master marks the worker as failed. Any map\\ntasks completed by the worker are reset back to their ini-\\ntial idle state, and therefore become eligible for schedul-\\ning on other workers. Similarly, any map task or reduce\\ntask in progress on a failed worker is also reset to idle\\nand becomes eligible for rescheduling.\\nCompleted map tasks are re-executed on a failure be-\\ncause their output is stored on the local disk(s) of the\\nfailed machine and is therefore inaccessible. Completed\\nreduce tasks do not need to be re-executed since their\\noutput is stored in a global \\x02le system.\\nWhen a map task is executed \\x02rst by worker A and\\nthen later executed by worker B (because A failed), all\\nTo appear in OSDI 2004 4\"),\n",

Any reduce task that has not already read the\\ndata from worker A will read the data from worker B.\\nMapReduce is resilient to large-scale worker failures.\\nFor example, during one MapReduce operation, network\\nmaintenance on a running cluster was causing groups of\\n80 machines at a time to become unreachable for sev-\\neral minutes. The MapReduce master simply re-executed\\nthe work done by the unreachable worker machines, and\\ncontinued to make forward progress, eventually complet-\\ning the MapReduce operation.\\nMaster Failure\\nIt is easy to make the master write periodic checkpoints\\nof the master data structures described above. If the mas-\\nter task dies, a new copy can be started from the last\\ncheckpointed state. However, given that there is only a\\nsingle master, its failure is unlikely; therefore our cur-\\nrent implementation aborts the MapReduce computation\\nif the master fails. Clients can check for this condition\\nand retry the MapReduce operation if they desire.\\nSemantics in the Presence of Failures\\nWhen the user-supplied map and reduce operators are de-\\nterministic functions of their input values, our distributed\\nimplementation produces the same output as would have\\nbeen produced by a non-faulting sequential execution of\\nthe entire program.\\nWe rely on atomic commits of map and reduce task\\noutputs to achieve this property. Each in-progress task\\nwrites its output to private temporary \\x02les. A reduce task\\nproduces one such \\x02le, and a map task produces R such\\n\\x02les (one per reduce task). When a map task completes,\\nthe worker sends a message to the master and includes\\nthe names of the R temporary \\x02les in the message. If\\nthe master receives a completion message for an already\\ncompleted map task, it ignores the message. Otherwise,\\nit records the names of R \\x02les in a master data structure.\\nWhen a reduce task completes, the reduce worker\\natomically renames its temporary output \\x02le to the \\x02nal\\noutput \\x02le. If the same reduce task is executed on multi-\\nple machines, multiple rename calls will be executed for\\nthe same \\x02nal output \\x02le. We rely on the atomic rename\\noperation provided by the underlying \\x02le system to guar-\\nantee that the \\x02nal \\x02le system state contains just the data\\nproduced by one execution of the reduce task.\\nThe vast majority of our map and reduce operators are\\ndeterministic, and the fact that our semantics are equiv-\\nalent to a sequential execution in this case makes it very\\neasy for programmers to reason about their program's be-\\nhavior. When the map and/or reduce operators are non-\\ndeterministic, we provide weaker but still reasonable se-\\nmantics. In the presence of non-deterministic operators,\\nthe output of a particular reduce task R1 is equivalent to\\nthe output for R1 produced by a sequential execution of\\nthe non-deterministic program. However, the output for\\na different reduce task R2 may correspond to the output\\nfor R2 produced by a different sequential execution of\\nthe non-deterministic program.\\nConsider map task M and reduce tasks R1 and R2.\\nLet e(Ri ) be the execution of Ri that committed (there\\nis exactly one such execution). The weaker semantics\\narise because e(R1) may have read the output produced\\nby one execution of M and e(R2) may have read the\\noutput produced by a different execution of M .\\n3.4 Locality\\nNetwork bandwidth is a relatively scarce resource in our\\ncomputing environment. We conserve network band-\\nwidth by taking advantage of the fact that the input data\\n(managed by GFS [8]) is stored on the local disks of the\\nmachines that make up our cluster. GFS divides each\\n\\x02le into 64 MB blocks, and stores several copies of each\\nblock (typically 3 copies) on different machines. The\\nMapReduce master takes the location information of the\\ninput \\x02les into account and attempts to schedule a map\\ntask on a machine that contains a replica of the corre-\\nsponding input data. Failing that, it attempts to schedule\\na map task near a replica of that task's input data (e.g., on\\na worker machine that is on the same network switch as\\nthe machine containing the data). When running large\\nMapReduce operations on a signi\\x02cant fraction of the\\nworkers in a cluster, most input data is read locally and\\nconsumes no network bandwidth.\\n3.5 Task Granularity\\nWe subdivide the map phase into M pieces and the re-\\nduce phase into R pieces, as described above. Ideally, M\\nand R should be much larger than the number of worker\\nmachines. Having each worker perform many different\\ntasks improves dynamic load balancing, and also speeds\\nup recovery when a worker fails: the many map tasks\\nit has completed can be spread out across all the other\\nworker machines.\\nThere are practical bounds on how large M and R can\\nbe in our implementation, since the master must make\\nO(M + R) scheduling decisions and keeps O(M \\x03 R)\\nstate in memory as described above. (The constant fac-\\ntors for memory usage are small however: the O(M \\x03R)\\npiece of the state consists of approximately one byte of\\ndata per map task/reduce task pair.)\\nTo appear in OSDI 2004 5\"),\n",

We often per-\\nform MapReduce computations with M = 200; 000 and\\nR = 5; 000, using 2,000 worker machines.\\n3.6 Backup Tasks\\nOne of the common causes that lengthens the total time\\ntaken for a MapReduce operation is a \\x93straggler\\x94: a ma-\\nchine that takes an unusually long time to complete one\\nof the last few map or reduce tasks in the computation.\\nStragglers can arise for a whole host of reasons. For ex-\\nample, a machine with a bad disk may experience fre-\\nquent correctable errors that slow its read performance\\nfrom 30 MB/s to 1 MB/s. The cluster scheduling sys-\\ntem may have scheduled other tasks on the machine,\\ncausing it to execute the MapReduce code more slowly\\ndue to competition for CPU, memory, local disk, or net-\\nwork bandwidth. A recent problem we experienced was\\na bug in machine initialization code that caused proces-\\nsor caches to be disabled: computations on affected ma-\\nchines slowed down by over a factor of one hundred.\\nWe have a general mechanism to alleviate the prob-\\nlem of stragglers. When a MapReduce operation is close\\nto completion, the master schedules backup executions\\nof the remaining in-progress tasks. The task is marked\\nas completed whenever either the primary or the backup\\nexecution completes. We have tuned this mechanism so\\nthat it typically increases the computational resources\\nused by the operation by no more than a few percent.\\nWe have found that this signi\\x02cantly reduces the time\\nto complete large MapReduce operations. As an exam-\\nple, the sort program described in Section 5.3 takes 44%\\nlonger to complete when the backup task mechanism is\\ndisabled.\\n4 Re\\x02nements\\nAlthough the basic functionality provided by simply\\nwriting Map and Reduce functions is suf\\x02cient for most\\nneeds, we have found a few extensions useful. These are\\ndescribed in this section.\\n4.1 Partitioning Function\\nThe users of MapReduce specify the number of reduce\\ntasks/output \\x02les that they desire (R). Data gets parti-\\ntioned across these tasks using a partitioning function on\\nthe intermediate key. A default partitioning function is\\nprovided that uses hashing (e.g. \\x93hash(key) mod R\\x94).\\nThis tends to result in fairly well-balanced partitions. In\\nsome cases, however, it is useful to partition data by\\nsome other function of the key. For example, sometimes\\nthe output keys are URLs, and we want all entries for a\\nsingle host to end up in the same output \\x02le. To support\\nsituations like this, the user of the MapReduce library\\ncan provide a special partitioning function. For example,\\nusing \\x93hash(H ostname(urlkey)) mod R\\x94 as the par-\\ntitioning function causes all URLs from the same host to\\nend up in the same output \\x02le.\\n4.2 Ordering Guarantees\\nWe guarantee that within a given partition, the interme-\\ndiate key/value pairs are processed in increasing key or-\\nder. This ordering guarantee makes it easy to generate\\na sorted output \\x02le per partition, which is useful when\\nthe output \\x02le format needs to support ef\\x02cient random\\naccess lookups by key, or users of the output \\x02nd it con-\\nvenient to have the data sorted.\\n4.3 Combiner Function\\nIn some cases, there is signi\\x02cant repetition in the inter-\\nmediate keys produced by each map task, and the user-\\nspeci\\x02ed Reduce function is commutative and associa-\\ntive. A good example of this is the word counting exam-\\nple in Section 2.1. Since word frequencies tend to follow\\na Zipf distribution, each map task will produce hundreds\\nor thousands of records of the form <the, 1>. All of\\nthese counts will be sent over the network to a single re-\\nduce task and then added together by the Reduce function\\nto produce one number. We allow the user to specify an\\noptional Combiner function that does partial merging of\\nthis data before it is sent over the network.\\nThe Combiner function is executed on each machine\\nthat performs a map task. Typically the same code is used\\nto implement both the combiner and the reduce func-\\ntions. The only difference between a reduce function and\\na combiner function is how the MapReduce library han-\\ndles the output of the function. The output of a reduce\\nfunction is written to the \\x02nal output \\x02le. The output of\\na combiner function is written to an intermediate \\x02le that\\nwill be sent to a reduce task.\\nPartial combining signi\\x02cantly speeds up certain\\nclasses of MapReduce operations. Appendix A contains\\nan example that uses a combiner.\\n4.4 Input and Output Types\\nThe MapReduce library provides support for reading in-\\nput data in several different formats.

Another common supported format stores a\\nsequence of key/value pairs sorted by key. Each input\\ntype implementation knows how to split itself into mean-\\ningful ranges for processing as separate map tasks (e.g.\\ntext mode's range splitting ensures that range splits oc-\\ncur only at line boundaries). Users can add support for a\\nnew input type by providing an implementation of a sim-\\nple reader interface, though most users just use one of a\\nsmall number of prede\\x02ned input types.\\nA reader does not necessarily need to provide data\\nread from a \\x02le. For example, it is easy to de\\x02ne a reader\\nthat reads records from a database, or from data struc-\\ntures mapped in memory.\\nIn a similar fashion, we support a set of output types\\nfor producing data in different formats and it is easy for\\nuser code to add support for new output types.\\n4.5 Side-effects\\nIn some cases, users of MapReduce have found it con-\\nvenient to produce auxiliary \\x02les as additional outputs\\nfrom their map and/or reduce operators. We rely on the\\napplication writer to make such side-effects atomic and\\nidempotent. Typically the application writes to a tempo-\\nrary \\x02le and atomically renames this \\x02le once it has been\\nfully generated.\\nWe do not provide support for atomic two-phase com-\\nmits of multiple output \\x02les produced by a single task.\\nTherefore, tasks that produce multiple output \\x02les with\\ncross-\\x02le consistency requirements should be determin-\\nistic. This restriction has never been an issue in practice.\\n4.6 Skipping Bad Records\\nSometimes there are bugs in user code that cause the Map\\nor Reduce functions to crash deterministically on certain\\nrecords. Such bugs prevent a MapReduce operation from\\ncompleting. The usual course of action is to \\x02x the bug,\\nbut sometimes this is not feasible; perhaps the bug is in\\na third-party library for which source code is unavail-\\nable. Also, sometimes it is acceptable to ignore a few\\nrecords, for example when doing statistical analysis on\\na large data set. We provide an optional mode of execu-\\ntion where the MapReduce library detects which records\\ncause deterministic crashes and skips these records in or-\\nder to make forward progress.\\nEach worker process installs a signal handler that\\ncatches segmentation violations and bus errors. Before\\ninvoking a user Map or Reduce operation, the MapRe-\\nduce library stores the sequence number of the argument\\nin a global variable. If the user code generates a signal,\\nthe signal handler sends a \\x93last gasp\\x94 UDP packet that\\ncontains the sequence number to the MapReduce mas-\\nter. When the master has seen more than one failure on\\na particular record, it indicates that the record should be\\nskipped when it issues the next re-execution of the corre-\\nsponding Map or Reduce task.\\n4.7 Local Execution\\nDebugging problems in Map or Reduce functions can be\\ntricky, since the actual computation happens in a dis-\\ntributed system, often on several thousand machines,\\nwith work assignment decisions made dynamically by\\nthe master. To help facilitate debugging, pro\\x02ling, and\\nsmall-scale testing, we have developed an alternative im-\\nplementation of the MapReduce library that sequentially\\nexecutes all of the work for a MapReduce operation on\\nthe local machine. Controls are provided to the user so\\nthat the computation can be limited to particular map\\ntasks. Users invoke their program with a special \\x03ag and\\ncan then easily use any debugging or testing tools they\\n\\x02nd useful (e.g. gdb).\\n4.8 Status Information\\nThe master runs an internal HTTP server and exports\\na set of status pages for human consumption. The sta-\\ntus pages show the progress of the computation, such as\\nhow many tasks have been completed, how many are in\\nprogress, bytes of input, bytes of intermediate data, bytes\\nof output, processing rates, etc. The pages also contain\\nlinks to the standard error and standard output \\x02les gen-\\nerated by each task. The user can use this data to pre-\\ndict how long the computation will take, and whether or\\nnot more resources should be added to the computation.\\nThese pages can also be used to \\x02gure out when the com-\\nputation is much slower than expected.\\nIn addition, the top-level status page shows which\\nworkers have failed, and which map and reduce tasks\\nthey were processing when they failed. This informa-\\ntion is useful when attempting to diagnose bugs in the\\nuser code.\\n4.9 Counters\\nThe MapReduce library provides a counter facility to\\ncount occurrences of various events. For example, user\\ncode may want to count total number of words processed\\nor the number of German documents indexed, etc.\\nTo use this facility, user code creates a named counter\\nobject and then increments the counter appropriately in\\nthe Map and/or Reduce function. For example:\\nTo appear in OSDI 2004 7\"),\n",

The master aggregates the counter\\nvalues from successful map and reduce tasks and returns\\nthem to the user code when the MapReduce operation\\nis completed. The current counter values are also dis-\\nplayed on the master status page so that a human can\\nwatch the progress of the live computation. When aggre-\\ngating counter values, the master eliminates the effects of\\nduplicate executions of the same map or reduce task to\\navoid double counting. (Duplicate executions can arise\\nfrom our use of backup tasks and from re-execution of\\ntasks due to failures.)\\nSome counter values are automatically maintained\\nby the MapReduce library, such as the number of in-\\nput key/value pairs processed and the number of output\\nkey/value pairs produced.\\nUsers have found the counter facility useful for san-\\nity checking the behavior of MapReduce operations. For\\nexample, in some MapReduce operations, the user code\\nmay want to ensure that the number of output pairs\\nproduced exactly equals the number of input pairs pro-\\ncessed, or that the fraction of German documents pro-\\ncessed is within some tolerable fraction of the total num-\\nber of documents processed.\\n5 Performance\\nIn this section we measure the performance of MapRe-\\nduce on two computations running on a large cluster of\\nmachines. One computation searches through approxi-\\nmately one terabyte of data looking for a particular pat-\\ntern. The other computation sorts approximately one ter-\\nabyte of data.\\nThese two programs are representative of a large sub-\\nset of the real programs written by users of MapReduce \\x96\\none class of programs shuf\\x03es data from one representa-\\ntion to another, and another class extracts a small amount\\nof interesting data from a large data set.\\n5.1 Cluster Con\\x02guration\\nAll of the programs were executed on a cluster that\\nconsisted of approximately 1800 machines.

The machines were\\narranged in a two-level tree-shaped switched network\\nwith approximately 100-200 Gbps of aggregate band-\\nwidth available at the root. All of the machines were\\nin the same hosting facility and therefore the round-trip\\ntime between any pair of machines was less than a mil-\\nlisecond.\\nOut of the 4GB of memory, approximately 1-1.5GB\\nwas reserved by other tasks running on the cluster. The\\nprograms were executed on a weekend afternoon, when\\nthe CPUs, disks, and network were mostly idle.\\n5.2 Grep\\nThe grep program scans through 1010 100-byte records,\\nsearching for a relatively rare three-character pattern (the\\npattern occurs in 92,337 records). The input is split into\\napproximately 64MB pieces (M = 15000), and the en-\\ntire output is placed in one \\x02le (R = 1).\\nFigure 2 shows the progress of the computation over\\ntime. The Y-axis shows the rate at which the input data is\\nscanned. The rate gradually picks up as more machines\\nare assigned to this MapReduce computation, and peaks\\nat over 30 GB/s when 1764 workers have been assigned.\\nAs the map tasks \\x02nish, the rate starts dropping and hits\\nzero about 80 seconds into the computation. The entire\\ncomputation takes approximately 150 seconds from start\\nto \\x02nish. This includes about a minute of startup over-\\nhead. The overhead is due to the propagation of the pro-\\ngram to all worker machines, and delays interacting with\\nGFS to open the set of 1000 input \\x02les and to get the\\ninformation needed for the locality optimization.\\n5.3 Sort\\nThe sort program sorts 1010 100-byte records (approxi-\\nmately 1 terabyte of data).

The indexing system takes\\nas input a large set of documents that have been retrieved\\nby our crawling system, stored as a set of GFS \\x02les.

Using MapReduce\\n(instead of the ad-hoc distributed passes in the prior ver-\\nsion of the indexing system) has provided several bene-\\n\\x02ts:\\n\\x0f The indexing code is simpler, smaller, and easier to\\nunderstand, because the code that deals with fault\\ntolerance, distribution and parallelization is hidden\\nwithin the MapReduce library.

This\\nmakes it easy to change the indexing process. For\\nexample, one change that took a few months to\\nmake in our old indexing system took only a few\\ndays to implement in the new system.\\n\\x0f The indexing process has become much easier to\\noperate, because most of the problems caused by\\nmachine failures, slow machines, and networking\\nhiccups are dealt with automatically by the MapRe-\\nduce library without operator intervention. Further-\\nmore, it is easy to improve the performance of the\\nindexing process by adding new machines to the in-\\ndexing cluster.\\n7 Related Work\\nMany systems have provided restricted programming\\nmodels and used the restrictions to parallelize the com-\\nputation automatically. For example, an associative func-\\ntion can be computed over all pre\\x02xes of an N element\\narray in log N time on N processors using parallel pre\\x02x\\ncomputations [6, 9, 13]. MapReduce can be considered\\na simpli\\x02cation and distillation of some of these models\\nbased on our experience with large real-world compu-\\ntations. More signi\\x02cantly, we provide a fault-tolerant\\nimplementation that scales to thousands of processors.\\nIn contrast, most of the parallel processing systems have\\nonly been implemented on smaller scales and leave the\\ndetails of handling machine failures to the programmer.\\nBulk Synchronous Programming [17] and some MPI\\nprimitives [11] provide higher-level abstractions that\\nmake it easier for programmers to write parallel pro-\\ngrams. A key difference between these systems and\\nMapReduce is that MapReduce exploits a restricted pro-\\ngramming model to parallelize the user program auto-\\nmatically and to provide transparent fault-tolerance.\\nOur locality optimization draws its inspiration from\\ntechniques such as active disks [12, 15], where compu-\\ntation is pushed into processing elements that are close\\nto local disks, to reduce the amount of data sent across\\nI/O subsystems or the network. We run on commodity\\nprocessors to which a small number of disks are directly\\nconnected instead of running directly on disk controller\\nprocessors, but the general approach is similar.\\nOur backup task mechanism is similar to the eager\\nscheduling mechanism employed in the Charlotte Sys-\\ntem [3]. One of the shortcomings of simple eager\\nscheduling is that if a given task causes repeated failures,\\nthe entire computation fails to complete. We \\x02x some in-\\nstances of this problem with our mechanism for skipping\\nbad records.\\nThe MapReduce implementation relies on an in-house\\ncluster management system that is responsible for dis-\\ntributing and running user tasks on a large collection of\\nshared machines. Though not the focus of this paper, the\\ncluster management system is similar in spirit to other\\nsystems such as Condor [16].\\nThe sorting facility that is a part of the MapReduce\\nlibrary is similar in operation to NOW-Sort [1]. Source\\nmachines (map workers) partition the data to be sorted\\nand send it to one of R reduce workers. Each reduce\\nworker sorts its data locally (in memory if possible). Of\\ncourse NOW-Sort does not have the user-de\\x02nable Map\\nand Reduce functions that make our library widely appli-\\ncable.\\nRiver [2] provides a programming model where pro-\\ncesses communicate with each other by sending data\\nover distributed queues. Like MapReduce, the River\\nsystem tries to provide good average case performance\\neven in the presence of non-uniformities introduced by\\nheterogeneous hardware or system perturbations. River\\nachieves this by careful scheduling of disk and network\\ntransfers to achieve balanced completion times. MapRe-\\nduce has a different approach. By restricting the pro-\\ngramming model, the MapReduce framework is able\\nto partition the problem into a large number of \\x02ne-\\ngrained tasks. These tasks are dynamically scheduled\\non available workers so that faster workers process more\\ntasks. The restricted programming model also allows\\nus to schedule redundant executions of tasks near the\\nend of the job which greatly reduces completion time in\\nthe presence of non-uniformities (such as slow or stuck\\nworkers).\\nBAD-FS [5] has a very different programming model\\nfrom MapReduce, and unlike MapReduce, is targeted to\\nTo appear in OSDI 2004 11'),\n",

We\\nattribute this success to several reasons. First, the model\\nis easy to use, even for programmers without experience\\nwith parallel and distributed systems, since it hides the\\ndetails of parallelization, fault-tolerance, locality opti-\\nmization, and load balancing. Second, a large variety\\nof problems are easily expressible as MapReduce com-\\nputations. For example, MapReduce is used for the gen-\\neration of data for Google's production web search ser-\\nvice, for sorting, for data mining, for machine learning,\\nand many other systems. Third, we have developed an\\nimplementation of MapReduce that scales to large clus-\\nters of machines comprising thousands of machines. The\\nimplementation makes ef\\x02cient use of these machine re-\\nsources and therefore is suitable for use on many of the\\nlarge computational problems encountered at Google.\\nWe have learned several things from this work. First,\\nrestricting the programming model makes it easy to par-\\nallelize and distribute computations and to make such\\ncomputations fault-tolerant. Second, network bandwidth\\nis a scarce resource. A number of optimizations in our\\nsystem are therefore targeted at reducing the amount of\\ndata sent across the network: the locality optimization al-\\nlows us to read data from local disks, and writing a single\\ncopy of the intermediate data to local disk saves network\\nbandwidth. Third, redundant execution can be used to\\nreduce the impact of slow machines, and to handle ma-\\nchine failures and data loss.\\nAcknowledgements\\nJosh Levenberg has been instrumental in revising and\\nextending the user-level MapReduce API with a num-\\nber of new features based on his experience with using\\nMapReduce and other people's suggestions for enhance-\\nments.

However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowl-\\nedge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their performance\\nlags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their\\ndecisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre-\\ntrained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric\\nmemory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We\\nexplore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation\\n(RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric mem-\\nory for language generation. We introduce RAG models where the parametric\\nmemory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense\\nvector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We com-\\npare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages\\nacross the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages\\nper token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-\\nintensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks,\\noutperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract\\narchitectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate\\nmore speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only\\nseq2seq baseline.\\n1 Introduction\\nPre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-\\nedge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized\\nimplicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-\\nsides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into\\ntheir predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric\\nmemory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these\\nissues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be\\ninspected and interpreted. REALM [ 20] and ORQA [ 31], two recently introduced models that\\ncombine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results,\\narXiv:2005.11401v4  [cs.CL]  12 Apr 2021'),\n",

For ﬁnal prediction y, we\\ntreat zas a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents.\\nbut have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric\\nand non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.\\nWe endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through\\na general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\\nWe build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the\\nnon-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural\\nretriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The\\nretriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on\\nthe input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with\\nthe input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation,\\neither on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token\\nbasis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.\\nThere has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric\\nmemory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [ 64, 55], stack-\\naugmented networks [25] and memory layers [ 30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both\\nparametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive\\nknowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is\\npresent without additional training.\\nOur results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-\\ntion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform\\nwithout access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results\\non open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform\\nrecent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being\\nextractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.\\nFor knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question\\ngeneration, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and\\ndiverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that\\nthe non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1\\n2 Methods\\nWe explore RAG models, which use the input sequencexto retrieve text documents zand use them\\nas additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models\\nleverage two components: (i) a retriever pη(z|x) with parameters ηthat returns (top-K truncated)\\ndistributions over text passages given a query xand (ii) a generator pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) parametrized\\n1Code to run experiments with RAG has been open-sourced as part of the HuggingFace Transform-\\ners Library [66] and can be found at https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/\\nexamples/rag/.

In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document\\nto predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based\\non a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the\\npη and pθ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure.\\n2.1 Models\\nRAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate\\nthe complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that\\nis marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y|x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the\\ntop K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence\\nprobability for each document, which are then marginalized,\\npRAG-Sequence(y|x) ≈\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(y|x,z) =\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)\\nN∏\\ni\\npθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nRAG-Token Model In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each\\ntarget token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several\\ndocuments when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the\\nretriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document,\\nbefore marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne:\\npRAG-Token(y|x) ≈\\nN∏\\ni\\n∑\\nz∈top-k(p(·|x))\\npη(z|x)pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1)\\nFinally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class\\nas a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent.\\n2.2 Retriever: DPR\\nThe retrieval component pη(z|x) is based on DPR [26]. DPR follows a bi-encoder architecture:\\npη(z|x) ∝exp\\n(\\nd(z)⊤q(x)\\n)\\nd(z) =BERTd(z), q(x) =BERTq(x)\\nwhere d(z) is a dense representation of a document produced by a BERTBASE document encoder [8],\\nand q(x) a query representation produced by a query encoder, also based on BERTBASE. Calculating\\ntop-k(pη(·|x)), the list of kdocuments zwith highest prior probability pη(z|x), is a Maximum Inner\\nProduct Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use\\na pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This\\nretriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and\\nNatural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.\\n2.3 Generator: BART\\nThe generator component pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1) could be modelled using any encoder-decoder. We use\\nBART-large [32], a pre-trained seq2seq transformer [58] with 400M parameters. To combine the input\\nxwith the retrieved content zwhen generating from BART, we simply concatenate them. BART was\\npre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained\\nstate-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5\\nmodels [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters θas the parametric memory henceforth.\\n2.4 Training\\nWe jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what\\ndocument should be retrieved.

Instead, we run beam search for\\neach document z, scoring each hypothesis using pθ(yi|x,z,y 1:i−1). This yields a set of hypotheses\\nY, some of which may not have appeared in the beams of all documents. To estimate the probability\\nof an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not\\nappear in the beam, multiply generator probability with pη(z|x) and then sum the probabilities across\\nbeams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer\\noutput sequences, |Y|can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding,\\nwe can make a further approximation that pθ(y|x,zi) ≈0 where ywas not generated during beam\\nsearch from x,zi. This avoids the need to run additional forward passes once the candidate set Y has\\nbeen generated. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Fast Decoding.”\\n3 Experiments\\nWe experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use\\na single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and\\nKarpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint\\n100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an\\nembedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical\\nNavigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top\\nkdocuments for each query. We consider k∈{5,10}for training and set kfor test time using dev\\ndata. We now discuss experimental details for each task.\\n3.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nOpen-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed\\nfor knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x,y)\\nand train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to\\nthe popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved\\ndocuments, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book\\nQA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead\\nrelying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural\\nQuestions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As\\nCT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG\\nmodel. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [ 31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM)\\nscores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set.\\n3.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nRAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive\\ntext generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting,\\nwe use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [ 43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages\\nretrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the\\nretrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat\\n4'),\n",

MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be\\nanswered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as\\n“What is the weather in V olcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.\\nWe also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,\\nRAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses.\\n3.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTo evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-\\neration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist\\nof short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.\\nJeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.\\nFor example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst\\ncountry to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise,\\nfactual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a\\nchallenging knowledge-intensive generation task.\\nWe use the splits from SearchQA [ 10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As\\nthis is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the\\nSQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [ 42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for\\nmatching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than\\nstandard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and\\none for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external\\nsources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [ 33]. We follow\\nbest practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two\\ngenerated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four\\noptions—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good.\\n3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nFEVER [ 56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by\\nWikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving\\nevidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify\\nwhether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem\\ncoupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for\\nexploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER\\nclass labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with\\nclaim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on\\nretrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and\\nmodels that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore\\ntwo variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way\\n(supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Open-domain Question Answering\\nTable 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA\\ntasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines\\nthe generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of\\n\"open-book\" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results\\nwithout expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s\\nretriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions\\nand TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-\\nencoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a\\nre-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.\\nThere are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-\\nments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards\\na correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading\\n5'),\n",

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers\\neven when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such\\ncases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%.\\n4.2 Abstractive Question Answering\\nAs shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu\\npoints and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is\\nimpressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to\\ngenerate the reference answer , (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and\\n(iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers\\nfrom our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually\\ncorrect text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than\\nBART generations (see §4.5).\\n4.3 Jeopardy Question Generation\\nTable 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation,\\nwith both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452\\npairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual\\nthan RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both RAG and\\nBART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of RAG on\\nthe task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more\\nspeciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.\\nJeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform\\nbest because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows\\nan example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The\\nSun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is\\ngenerated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.\\nThis observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc\\ndocuments. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We\\nﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding\"The\\nSun. BART completes the generation \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"The Sun\\nAlso Rises\" indicating the title \"The Sun Also Rises\" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,\\nBART will complete the partial decoding \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A\\nwith \"The Sun Also Rises\" is a novel by this author of \"A Farewell to Arms\". This example shows\\nhow parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps\\nto guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory.\\n4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation\\nTable 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of\\nstate-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and\\nsubstantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require.\\n6'),\n",

We calculate the overlap in article titles between the topkdocuments retrieved\\nby RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article\\nin 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases.\\n4.5 Additional Results\\nGeneration Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than\\nBART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding\\n[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to\\ntotal ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are\\nmore diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing\\nany diversity-promoting decoding.\\nRetrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.\\nTo assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever\\nduring training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks.\\nWe compare RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace\\nRAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating\\np(z|x). Table 6 shows the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are\\nheavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval\\nimproves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.\\nIndex hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge\\ncan be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to\\nupdate their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]\\nWikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer\\nindex from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed\\n7'),\n",

A single, pre-trained language model\\nhas been shown to achieve strong performance on various classiﬁcation tasks in the GLUE bench-\\nmarks [60, 61] after ﬁne-tuning [49, 8]. GPT-2 [50] later showed that a single, left-to-right, pre-trained\\nlanguage model could achieve strong performance across both discriminative and generative tasks.\\nFor further improvement, BART [32] and T5 [51, 52] propose a single, pre-trained encoder-decoder\\nmodel that leverages bi-directional attention to achieve stronger performance on discriminative\\nand generative tasks. Our work aims to expand the space of possible tasks with a single, uniﬁed\\narchitecture, by learning a retrieval module to augment pre-trained, generative language models.\\nLearned Retrieval There is signiﬁcant work on learning to retrieve documents in information\\nretrieval, more recently with pre-trained, neural language models [ 44, 26] similar to ours. Some\\nwork optimizes the retrieval module to aid in a speciﬁc, downstream task such as question answering,\\nusing search [46], reinforcement learning [6, 63, 62], or a latent variable approach [31, 20] as in our\\nwork. These successes leverage different retrieval-based architectures and optimization techniques to\\nachieve strong performance on a single task, while we show that a single retrieval-based architecture\\ncan be ﬁne-tuned for strong performance on a variety of tasks.\\nMemory-based Architectures Our document index can be seen as a large external memory for\\nneural networks to attend to, analogous to memory networks [64, 55]. Concurrent work [14] learns\\nto retrieve a trained embedding for each entity in the input, rather than to retrieve raw text as in our\\nwork. Other work improves the ability of dialog models to generate factual text by attending over\\nfact embeddings [15, 13]. A key feature of our memory is that it is comprised of raw text rather\\ndistributed representations, which makes the memory both (i) human-readable, lending a form of\\ninterpretability to our model, and (ii) human-writable, enabling us to dynamically update the model’s\\nmemory by editing the document index. This approach has also been used in knowledge-intensive\\ndialog, where generators have been conditioned on retrieved text directly, albeit obtained via TF-IDF\\nrather than end-to-end learnt retrieval [9].\\nRetrieve-and-Edit approaches Our method shares some similarities with retrieve-and-edit style\\napproaches, where a similar training input-output pair is retrieved for a given input, and then edited\\nto provide a ﬁnal output. These approaches have proved successful in a number of domains including\\nMachine Translation [ 18, 22] and Semantic Parsing [21]. Our approach does have several differences,\\nincluding less of emphasis on lightly editing a retrieved item, but on aggregating content from several\\npieces of retrieved content, as well as learning latent retrieval, and retrieving evidence documents\\nrather than related training pairs. This said, RAG techniques may work well in these settings, and\\ncould represent promising future work.\\n6 Discussion\\nIn this work, we presented hybrid generation models with access to parametric and non-parametric\\nmemory. We showed that our RAG models obtain state of the art results on open-domain QA. We\\nfound that people prefer RAG’s generation over purely parametric BART, ﬁnding RAG more factual\\nand speciﬁc. We conducted an thorough investigation of the learned retrieval component, validating\\nits effectiveness, and we illustrated how the retrieval index can be hot-swapped to update the model\\nwithout requiring any retraining. In future work, it may be fruitful to investigate if the two components\\ncan be jointly pre-trained from scratch, either with a denoising objective similar to BART or some\\nanother objective. Our work opens up new research directions on how parametric and non-parametric\\nmemories interact and how to most effectively combine them, showing promise in being applied to a\\nwide variety of NLP tasks.\\n9'),\n",

These\\nanswer annotations are exploited by extractive models during training as typically all the answer\\nannotations are used to ﬁnd matches within documents when preparing training data. For RAG, we\\nalso make use of multiple annotation examples for Natural Questions and WebQuestions by training\\nthe model with each (q,a) pair separately, leading to a small increase in accuracy. For TriviaQA,\\nthere are often many valid answers to a given question, some of which are not suitable training targets,\\nsuch as emoji or spelling variants. For TriviaQA, we ﬁlter out answer candidates if they do not occur\\nin top 1000 documents for the query.\\nCuratedTrec preprocessing The answers for CuratedTrec are given in the form of regular expres-\\nsions, which has been suggested as a reason why it is unsuitable for answer-generation models [20].\\nTo overcome this, we use a pre-processing step where we ﬁrst retrieve the top 1000 documents for\\neach query, and use the answer that most frequently matches the regex pattern as the supervision\\ntarget. If no matches are found, we resort to a simple heuristic: generate all possible permutations for\\neach regex, replacing non-deterministic symbols in the regex nested tree structure with a whitespace.\\nTriviaQA Evaluation setups The open-domain QA community customarily uses public develop-\\nment datasets as test datasets, as test data for QA datasets is often restricted and dedicated to reading\\ncompehension purposes. We report our results using the datasets splits used in DPR [26], which are\\nconsistent with common practice in Open-domain QA. For TriviaQA, this test dataset is the public\\nTriviaQA Web Development split. Roberts et al.[52] used the TriviaQA ofﬁcial Wikipedia test set\\ninstead. Févry et al. [14] follow this convention in order to compare with Roberts et al. [52] (See\\nappendix of [14]). We report results on both test sets to enable fair comparison to both approaches.\\nWe ﬁnd that our performance is much higher using the ofﬁcial Wiki test set, rather than the more\\nconventional open-domain test set, which we attribute to the ofﬁcial Wiki test set questions being\\nsimpler to answer from Wikipedia.\\nE Further Details on FEVER\\nFor FEVER classiﬁcation, we follow the practice from [ 32], and ﬁrst re-generate the claim, and\\nthen classify using the representation of the ﬁnal hidden state, before ﬁnally marginalizing across\\ndocuments to obtain the class probabilities. The FEVER task traditionally has two sub-tasks. The\\nﬁrst is to classify the claim as either \"Supported\", \"Refuted\" or \"Not Enough Info\", which is the task\\nwe explore in the main paper. FEVER’s other sub-task involves extracting sentences from Wikipedia\\nas evidence supporting the classiﬁcation prediction. As FEVER uses a different Wikipedia dump to\\nus, directly tackling this task is not straightforward. We hope to address this in future work.\\nF Null Document Probabilities\\nWe experimented with adding \"Null document\" mechanism to RAG, similar to REALM [20] in order\\nto model cases where no useful information could be retrieved for a given input. Here, ifkdocuments\\nwere retrieved, we would additionally \"retrieve\" an empty document and predict a logit for the null\\ndocument, before marginalizing over k+ 1predictions. We explored modelling this null document\\nlogit by learning (i) a document embedding for the null document, (ii) a static learnt bias term, or\\n(iii) a neural network to predict the logit. We did not ﬁnd that these improved performance, so in\\nthe interests of simplicity, we omit them. For Open MS-MARCO, where useful retrieved documents\\ncannot always be retrieved, we observe that the model learns to always retrieve a particular set of\\ndocuments for questions that are less likely to beneﬁt from retrieval, suggesting that null document\\nmechanisms may not be necessary for RAG.\\nG Parameters\\nOur RAG models contain the trainable parameters for the BERT-base query and document encoder of\\nDPR, with 110M parameters each (although we do not train the document encoder ourselves) and\\n406M trainable parameters from BART-large, 406M parameters, making a total of 626M trainable\\n18'),\n",

INTRODUCTION\\nWe have designed and implemented the Google File Sys-\\ntem (GFS) to meet therapidly growing demandsof Google’s\\ndata processing needs. GFS shares many of the same goals\\nas previous distributed ﬁle systems such as performance,\\nscalability, reliability, and availability. However, its design\\nhas been driven bykey observations of our application work-\\nloads and technological environment, both current and an-\\nticipated, that reﬂect a marked departure from some earlier\\nﬁle system design assumptions. We have reexamined tradi-\\ntional choices and explored radically diﬀerent points in the\\ndesign space.\\nFirst, component failures are the norm rather than the\\nexception. The ﬁle system consists of hundreds or even\\nthousands of storage machines built from inexpensive com-\\nmodity parts and is accessed by a comparable number of\\nclient machines. The quantity and quality of the compo-\\nnents virtually guarantee that some are not functional at\\nany given time and some will not recover from their cur-\\nrent failures. We have seen problems caused by application\\nbugs, operating system bugs, human errors, and the failures\\nof disks, memory, connectors, networking, and power sup-\\nplies. Therefore, constant monitoring, error detection, fault\\ntolerance, and automatic recovery must be integral to the\\nsystem.\\nSecond, ﬁles are huge by traditional standards. Multi-GB\\nﬁles are common. Each ﬁle typically contains many applica-\\ntion objects such as web documents. When we are regularly\\nworking with fast growing datasets of manyTBs comprising\\nbillions of objects, it is unwieldy to manage billions of ap-\\nproximately KB-sized ﬁles even when the ﬁle system could\\nsupport it. As a result, design assumptions and parameters\\nsuch as I/O operation and blocksizes have to be revisited.\\nThird, most ﬁles are mutated by appending new data\\nratherthanoverwritingexistingdata. Randomwriteswithin\\na ﬁle are practically non-existent. Once written, the ﬁles\\nare only read, and often only sequentially. A variety of\\ndata share these characteristics. Some may constitute large\\nrepositoriesthatdataanalysisprogramsscanthrough. Some\\nmay be data streams continuously generated by running ap-\\nplications. Some may be archival data. Some may be in-\\ntermediate results produced on one machine and processed\\non another, whether simultaneously or later in time. Given\\nthis access pattern on huge ﬁles, appending becomes the fo-\\ncus of performance optimization and atomicity guarantees,\\nwhile caching data blocks in the client loses its appeal.\\nFourth, co-designing the applications and the ﬁle system\\nAPI beneﬁts the overall system by increasing our ﬂexibility.'),\n",

We have also introduced an\\natomic appendoperation sothatmultipleclientscan append\\nconcurrently to a ﬁle without extra synchronization between\\nthem. These will be discussed in more details later in the\\npaper.\\nMultiple GFS clusters are currently deployed for diﬀerent\\npurposes. The largest ones have over 1000 storage nodes,\\nover 300 TB of diskstorage, and are heavily accessed by\\nhundreds of clients on distinct machines on a continuous\\nbasis.\\n2. DESIGN OVERVIEW\\n2.1 Assumptions\\nIn designing a ﬁle system for our needs, we have been\\nguided by assumptions that oﬀer both challenges and op-\\nportunities. We alluded to some key observations earlier\\nand now lay out our assumptions in more details.\\n\\x7f The system is built from many inexpensive commodity\\ncomponentsthatoften fail. Itmustconstantlymonitor\\nitself and detect, tolerate, and recover promptly from\\ncomponent failures on a routine basis.\\n\\x7f The system stores a modest number of large ﬁles. We\\nexpect a few million ﬁles, each typically 100 MB or\\nlarger in size. Multi-GB ﬁles are the common case\\nand should be managed eﬃciently. Small ﬁles must be\\nsupported, but we need not optimize for them.\\n\\x7f The workloads primarily consist of two kinds of reads:\\nlarge streaming reads and small random reads. In\\nlarge streaming reads, individual operations typically\\nread hundreds of KBs, more commonly 1 MB or more.\\nSuccessive operations from the same client often read\\nthrough a contiguous region of a ﬁle. A small ran-\\ndom read typically reads a few KBs at some arbitrary\\noﬀset. Performance-conscious applications often batch\\nand sort their small reads to advance steadily through\\nthe ﬁle rather than go backand forth.\\n\\x7f The workloads also have many large, sequential writes\\nthat append data to ﬁles. Typical operation sizes are\\nsimilar to those for reads. Once written, ﬁles are sel-\\ndom modiﬁed again. Small writes at arbitrary posi-\\ntions in a ﬁle are supported but do not have to be\\neﬃcient.\\n\\x7f The system must eﬃciently implement well-deﬁned se-\\nmantics for multiple clients that concurrently append\\nto the same ﬁle. Our ﬁles are often used as producer-\\nconsumer queues or for many-way merging. Hundreds\\nof producers, running one per machine, will concur-\\nrently append to a ﬁle. Atomicity with minimal syn-\\nchronization overhead is essential. The ﬁle may be\\nread later, or a consumer may be reading through the\\nﬁle simultaneously.\\n\\x7f High sustained bandwidth is more important than low\\nlatency. Most of our target applications place a pre-\\nmium on processing data in bulkat a high rate, while\\nfew have stringent response time requirements for an\\nindividual read or write.\\n2.2 Interface\\nGFS provides a familiar ﬁle system interface, though it\\ndoesnotimplementastandardAPIsuchasPOSIX.Filesare\\norganizedhierarchically indirectoriesandidentiﬁedbypath-\\nnames. We support the usual operations tocreate, delete,\\nopen, close, read,a n dwrite ﬁles.\\nMoreover, GFS has snapshot and record appendopera-\\ntions. Snapshot creates a copy of a ﬁle or a directory tree\\nat low cost. Record append allows multiple clients to ap-\\npend data to the same ﬁle concurrently while guaranteeing\\nthe atomicity of each individual client’s append. It is use-\\nful for implementing multi-way merge results and producer-\\nconsumer queues that many clients can simultaneously ap-\\npend to without additional locking. We have found these\\ntypes of ﬁles to be invaluable in building large distributed\\napplications. Snapshotand record appendare discussed fur-\\nther in Sections 3.4 and 3.3 respectively.\\n2.3 Architecture\\nA GFS cluster consists of a singlemaster and multiple\\nchunkservers and is accessed by multipleclients,a ss h o w n\\nin Figure 1. Each of these is typically a commodity Linux\\nmachine runninga user-level server process. Itis easy to run\\nbothachunkserverandaclientonthesamemachine, aslong\\nas machine resources permit and the lower reliability caused\\nby running possibly ﬂaky application code is acceptable.\\nFiles are divided into ﬁxed-sizechunks. Each chunkis\\nidentiﬁed by an immutable and globally unique 64 bitchunk\\nhandleassigned by the master at the time of chunkcreation.\\nChunkservers store chunks on local disks as Linux ﬁles and\\nread or write chunkdata speciﬁed by a chunkhandle and\\nbyterange. For reliability, each chunkis replicated on multi-\\nplechunkservers. By default, we store threereplicas, though\\nusers can designate diﬀerent replication levels for diﬀerent\\nregions of the ﬁle namespace.\\nThe master maintains all ﬁle system metadata. This in-\\ncludes the namespace, access control information, the map-\\npingfromﬁlestochunks,andthecurrentlocationsofchunks.\\nIt also controls system-wide activities such as chunklease\\nmanagement, garbage collection of orphaned chunks, and\\nchunkmigration between chunk servers. The master peri-\\nodically communicates with each chunkserver inHeartBeat\\nmessages to give it instructions and collect its state.\\nGFS client code linked into each application implements\\nthe ﬁle system API and communicates with the master and\\nchunkservers to read or write data on behalf of the applica-\\ntion. Clients interact with the master for metadata opera-\\ntions, but all data-bearing communication goes directly to\\nthe chunkservers. We do not provide the POSIX API and\\ntherefore need not hookinto the Linux vnode layer.\\nNeither the client nor the chunkserver caches ﬁle data.\\nClient caches oﬀer little beneﬁt because most applications\\nstream through huge ﬁles or have working sets too large\\nto be cached. Not having them simpliﬁes the client and\\nthe overall system by eliminating cache coherence issues.\\n(Clients do cache metadata, however.) Chunkservers need\\nnot cache ﬁle data because chunks are stored as local ﬁles\\nandsoLinux’sbuﬀercachealreadykeepsfrequentlyaccessed\\ndata in memory.\\n2.4 Single Master\\nHaving a single master vastly simpliﬁes our design and\\nenables the master to make sophisticated chunk placement'),\n",

However,\\nwe must minimize its involvement in reads and writes so\\nthat it does not become a bottleneck. Clients never read\\nand write ﬁledata throughthemaster. Instead, a client asks\\nthe master which chunkservers it should contact. It caches\\nthis information for a limited time and interacts with the\\nchunkservers directly for many subsequent operations.\\nLetusexplaintheinteractionsforasimplereadwithrefer-\\nence to Figure 1. First, using the ﬁxed chunksize, the client\\ntranslates the ﬁle name and byte oﬀset speciﬁed by the ap-\\nplication into a chunkindex within the ﬁle. Then, it sends\\nthe master a request containing the ﬁle name and chunk\\nindex. The master replies with the corresponding chunk\\nhandle and locations of the replicas. The client caches this\\ninformation using the ﬁle name and chunkindex as the k ey.\\nThe client then sends a request to one of the replicas,\\nmost likely the closest one. The request speciﬁes the chunk\\nhandle and a byte range within that chunk. Further reads\\nof the same chunkrequire no more client-master interaction\\nuntil the cached information expires or the ﬁle is reopened.\\nIn fact, the client typically asks for multiple chunks in the\\nsame request and the master can also include the informa-\\ntion for chunks immediately following those requested. This\\nextra information sidesteps several future client-master in-\\nteractions at practically no extra cost.\\n2.5 Chunk Size\\nChunksize is one of the k ey design parameters. We have\\nchosen 64 MB, which is much larger than typical ﬁle sys-\\ntem blocksizes. Each chunkreplica is stored as a plain\\nLinux ﬁle on a chunkserver and is extended only as needed.\\nLazy space allocation avoids wasting space due to internal\\nfragmentation, perhaps the greatest objection against such\\na large chunksize.\\nA large chunksize oﬀers several important advantages.\\nFirst, it reduces clients’ need to interact with the master\\nbecause reads and writes on the same chunkrequire only\\none initial request to the master for chunklocation informa-\\ntion. The reduction is especially signiﬁcant for our work-\\nloads because applications mostly read and write large ﬁles\\nsequentially. Even for small random reads, the client can\\ncomfortably cache all the chunklocation information for a\\nmulti-TB working set. Second, since on a large chunk, a\\nclient is more likely to perform many operations on a given\\nchunk, it can reduce network overhead by keeping a persis-\\ntent TCP connection to the chunkserver over an extended\\nperiod of time. Third, it reduces the size of the metadata\\nstored on the master. This allows us to keep the metadata\\nin memory, which in turn brings other advantages that we\\nwill discuss in Section 2.6.1.\\nOntheotherhand,alargechunksize, evenwithlazyspace\\nallocation, has its disadvantages. A small ﬁle consists of a\\nsmall numberof chunks,perhapsjust one. The chunkservers\\nstoring those chunks may become hot spots if many clients\\nare accessing the same ﬁle. In practice, hot spots have not\\nbeen a major issue because our applications mostly read\\nlarge multi-chunkﬁles sequentially.\\nHowever, hot spots did develop when GFS was ﬁrst used\\nby a batch-queuesystem: an executable was written to GFS\\nas a single-chunkﬁle and then started on hundreds of ma-\\nchines at the same time. The few chunkservers storing this\\nexecutable were overloaded by hundreds of simultaneous re-\\nquests. We ﬁxed this problem by storing such executables\\nwith a higher replication factor and by making the batch-\\nqueue system stagger application start times. A potential\\nlong-term solution is to allow clients to read data from other\\nclients in such situations.\\n2.6 Metadata\\nThe master stores three major types of metadata: the ﬁle\\nand chunknamespaces, the mapping from ﬁles to chunk s,\\nand the locations of each chunk’s replicas. All metadata is\\nkept in the master’s memory. The ﬁrst two types (names-\\npaces and ﬁle-to-chunkmapping) are also k ept persistent by\\nlogging mutations to anoperation logstored on the mas-\\nter’s local diskand replicated on remote machines. Using\\na log allows us to update the master state simply, reliably,\\nand without risking inconsistencies in the event of a master\\ncrash. The master does not store chunklocation informa-\\ntion persistently. Instead, it asks each chunkserver about its\\nchunks at master startup and whenever a chunkserver joins\\nthe cluster.\\n2.6.1 In-Memory Data Structures\\nSincemetadataisstoredinmemory,masteroperationsare\\nfast.

Sections 4.3 and 4.4 will discuss\\nthese activities further.\\nOne potential concern for this memory-only approach is\\nthat the number of chunks and hence the capacity of the\\nwhole system is limited by how much memory the master\\nhas. This is not a serious limitation in practice. The mas-\\nter maintains less than 64 bytes of metadata for each 64 MB\\nchunk. Most chunksare full because mostﬁles containmany\\nchunks, only the last of which may be partially ﬁlled. Sim-\\nilarly, the ﬁle namespace data typically requires less then\\n64 bytes per ﬁle because it stores ﬁle names compactly us-\\ning preﬁx compression.\\nIf necessary to support even larger ﬁle systems, the cost\\nof adding extra memory to the master is a small price to pay\\nfor the simplicity, reliability, performance, and ﬂexibility we\\ngain by storing the metadata in memory.\\n2.6.2 Chunk Locations\\nThe master does not keep a persistent record of which\\nchunkservers have a replica of a given chunk. It simply polls\\nchunkservers for that information at startup. The master\\ncan keep itself up-to-date thereafter because it controls all\\nchunkplacement and monitors chunk server status with reg-\\nular HeartBeatmessages.\\nWeinitially attempted tokeep chunklocation information\\npersistently at the master, but we decided that it was much\\nsimpler to request the data from chunkservers at startup,\\nand periodically thereafter. This eliminated the problem of\\nkeepingthemasterand chunkserversin syncas chunkservers\\njoin and leave the cluster, change names, fail, restart, and\\nso on. In a cluster with hundreds of servers, these events\\nhappen all too often.\\nAnother way to understand this design decision is to real-\\nize that a chunkserver has the ﬁnal word over what chunks\\nit does or does not have on its own disks. There is no point\\nin trying to maintain a consistent view of this information\\non the master because errors on a chunkserver may cause\\nchunks to vanish spontaneously (e.g., a disk may go bad\\nand be disabled) or an operator may rename a chunkserver.\\n2.6.3 Operation Log\\nThe operation log contains a historical record of critical\\nmetadata changes. It is central to GFS. Not only is it the\\nonly persistent record of metadata, but it also serves as a\\nlogical time line that deﬁnes the order of concurrent op-\\nerations. Files and chunks, as well as their versions (see\\nSection 4.5), are all uniquely and eternally identiﬁed by the\\nlogical times at which they were created.\\nSince the operation log is critical, we must store it reli-\\nably and not make changes visible to clients until metadata\\nchanges are made persistent. Otherwise, we eﬀectively lose\\nthe whole ﬁle system or recent client operations even if the\\nchunks themselves survive. Therefore, we replicate it on\\nmultiple remote machines and respond to a client opera-\\ntion only after ﬂushing the corresponding log record to disk\\nboth locally and remotely. The master batches several log\\nrecords together before ﬂushingtherebyreducing theimpact\\nof ﬂushing and replication on overall system throughput.\\nThe master recovers its ﬁle system state by replaying the\\noperation log. To minimize startup time, we must keep the\\nlog small. The master checkpoints its state wheneverthe log\\ngrows beyond a certain size so that it can recover by loading\\nthe latest checkpoint from local disk and replaying only the\\nWrite\\n Record Append\\nSerial\\n deﬁned\\n deﬁned\\nsuccess\\n interspersed with\\nConcurrent\\n consistent\\n inconsistent\\nsuccesses\\n but undeﬁned\\nFailure\\n inconsistent\\nTable 1: File Region State After Mutation\\nlimited number of log records after that. The checkpoint is\\nin a compact B-tree like form that can be directly mapped\\ninto memory and used for namespace lookup without ex-\\ntra parsing. This further speeds up recovery and improves\\navailability.\\nBecause building a checkpoint can take a while, the mas-\\nter’s internal state is structured in such a way that a new\\ncheckpoint can be created without delaying incoming muta-\\ntions. The master switches to a new log ﬁle and creates the\\nnew checkpoint in a separate thread. The new checkpoint\\nincludes all mutations before the switch. It can be created\\nin a minute or so for a cluster with a few million ﬁles. When\\ncompleted, it is written to diskboth locally and remotely.\\nRecovery needs only the latest complete checkpoint and\\nsubsequent log ﬁles. Older checkpoints and log ﬁles can\\nbe freely deleted, though we keep a few around to guard\\nagainst catastrophes. A failure during checkpointing does\\nnot aﬀect correctness because the recovery code detects and\\nskips incomplete checkpoints.\\n2.7 Consistency Model\\nGFS has a relaxed consistency model that supports our\\nhighly distributed applications well but remains relatively\\nsimple and eﬃcient to implement. We now discuss GFS’s\\nguarantees and what they mean to applications. We also\\nhighlight how GFS maintains these guarantees but leave the\\ndetails to other parts of the paper.\\n2.7.1 Guarantees by GFS\\nFile namespace mutations (e.g., ﬁle creation) are atomic.\\nThey are handled exclusively by the master: namespace\\nlocking guarantees atomicity and correctness (Section 4.1);\\nthe master’s operation log deﬁnes a global total order of\\nthese operations (Section 2.6.3).\\nThe state of a ﬁle region after a data mutation depends\\non the type of mutation, whether it succeeds or fails, and\\nwhether there are concurrent mutations. Table 1 summa-\\nrizes the result. A ﬁle region isconsistentif all clients will\\nalways see the same data, regardless of which replicas they\\nread from. A region isdeﬁnedafter a ﬁle data mutation if it\\nis consistent and clients will see what the mutation writes in\\nits entirety. When a mutation succeeds without interference\\nfrom concurrent writers, the aﬀected region is deﬁned (and\\nby implication consistent): all clients will always see what\\nthe mutation has written. Concurrent successful mutations\\nleave the region undeﬁned but consistent: all clients see the\\nsame data, but it may not reﬂect what any one mutation\\nhas written. Typically, it consists of mingled fragments from\\nmultiple mutations. A failed mutation makes the region in-\\nconsistent (hence also undeﬁned): diﬀerent clients may see\\ndiﬀerent data at diﬀerent times. We describe below how our\\napplications can distinguish deﬁned regions from undeﬁned'),\n",

The applications do not need to further distinguish\\nbetween diﬀerent kinds of undeﬁned regions.\\nData mutations may bewritesor record appends.Aw r i t e\\ncauses data to be written at an application-speciﬁed ﬁle\\noﬀset. A record append causes data (the “record”) to be\\nappended atomically at least onceeven in the presence of\\nconcurrent mutations, but at an oﬀset of GFS’s choosing\\n(Section 3.3). (In contrast, a “regular” append is merely a\\nwrite at an oﬀset that the client believes to be the current\\nend of ﬁle.) The oﬀset is returned to the client and marks\\nthe beginning of a deﬁned region that contains the record.\\nIn addition, GFS may insert padding or record duplicates in\\nbetween. They occupy regions considered to be inconsistent\\nand are typically dwarfed by the amount of user data.\\nAfter a sequence of successful mutations, the mutated ﬁle\\nregion is guaranteed to bedeﬁnedand contain thedata writ-\\nten by the last mutation. GFS achieves this by (a) applying\\nmutations to a chunkin the same order on all its replicas\\n(Section 3.1), and(b)using chunkversion numbersto detect\\nany replica that has become stale because it has missed mu-\\ntations while its chunkserver was down (Section 4.5). Stale\\nreplicas will never be involved in a mutation or given to\\nclients asking the master for chunk locations. They are\\ngarbage collected at the earliest opportunity.\\nSince clients cache chunklocations, they may read from a\\nstale replica before that information is refreshed. This win-\\ndow is limited by the cache entry’s timeout and the next\\nopen of the ﬁle, which purges from the cache all chunkin-\\nformation for that ﬁle. Moreover, as most of our ﬁles are\\nappend-only, a stale replica usually returns a premature\\nend of chunkrather than outdated data. When a reader\\nretries and contacts the master, it will immediately get cur-\\nrent chunklocations.\\nLong after a successful mutation, component failures can\\nof course still corrupt or destroy data. GFS identiﬁes failed\\nchunkservers by regular handshakes between master and all\\nchunkservers and detects data corruption by checksumming\\n(Section 5.2). Once a problem surfaces, the data is restored\\nfrom validreplicasassoon aspossible(Section4.3). Achunk\\nis lost irreversibly only if all its replicas are lost before GFS\\ncan react, typically within minutes. Even in this case, it be-\\ncomes unavailable, not corrupted: applications receive clear\\nerrors rather than corrupt data.\\n2.7.2 Implications for Applications\\nGFS applications can accommodate the relaxed consis-\\ntency model with a few simple techniquesalready needed for\\nother purposes: relying on appends rather than overwrites,\\ncheckpointing, and writing self-validating, self-identifying\\nrecords.\\nPractically all our applications mutate ﬁles by appending\\nrather than overwriting. In one typical use, a writer gener-\\nates a ﬁle from beginning to end. It atomically renames the\\nﬁle to a permanent name after writing all the data, or pe-\\nriodically checkpoints how much has been successfully writ-\\nten. Checkpoints may also include application-level check-\\nsums. Readers verify and process only the ﬁle region up\\nto the last checkpoint, which is known to be in the deﬁned\\nstate. Regardless of consistency and concurrency issues, this\\napproach has served us well. Appending is far more eﬃ-\\ncient and more resilient to application failures than random\\nwrites. Checkpointing allows writers to restart incremen-\\ntally and keeps readers from processing successfully written\\nﬁle data that is still incomplete from the application’s per-\\nspective.\\nIn the other typical use, many writers concurrently ap-\\npend to a ﬁle for merged results or as a producer-consumer\\nqueue. Recordappend’sappend-at-least-oncesemanticspre-\\nserves each writer’s output. Readers deal with the occa-\\nsional padding and duplicates as follows. Each record pre-\\npared by the writer contains extra information like check-\\nsums so that its validity can be veriﬁed. A reader can\\nidentify and discard extra padding and record fragments\\nusing the checksums. If it cannot tolerate the occasional\\nduplicates (e.g., if they would trigger non-idempotent op-\\nerations), it can ﬁlter them out using unique identiﬁers in\\nthe records, which are often needed anyway to name corre-\\nsponding application entities such as web documents. These\\nfunctionalities for record I/O (except duplicate removal) are\\nin library code shared by our applications and applicable to\\nother ﬁle interface implementations at Google. With that,\\nthe same sequence of records, plus rare duplicates, is always\\ndelivered to the record reader.\\n3. SYSTEM INTERACTIONS\\nWe designed the system to minimize the master’s involve-\\nment in all operations. With that background, we now de-\\nscribe how the client, master, and chunkservers interact to\\nimplementdatamutations, atomicrecordappend,andsnap-\\nshot.\\n3.1 Leases and Mutation Order\\nA mutation is an operation that changes the contents or\\nmetadata of a chunksuch as a write or an append opera-\\ntion. Each mutation is performed at all the chunk’sreplicas.\\nWeuseleases to maintain aconsistent mutation order across\\nreplicas. The master grants a chunklease to one of the repli-\\ncas, which we call theprimary. The primary picks a serial\\norder for all mutations to the chunk. All replicas follow this\\norder when applying mutations. Thus, the global mutation\\norder is deﬁned ﬁrst by the lease grant order chosen by the\\nmaster, and within a lease by the serial numbers assigned\\nby the primary.\\nThe lease mechanism is designed to minimize manage-\\nment overhead at the master. A lease has an initial timeout\\nof 60 seconds. However, as long as the chunkis being mu-\\ntated, the primary can request and typically receive exten-\\nsions from the master indeﬁnitely. These extension requests\\nand grants are piggybacked on theHeartBeatmessages reg-\\nularly exchanged between the master and all chunkservers.\\nThe master may sometimes try to revoke a lease before it\\nexpires (e.g., when the master wants to disable mutations\\non a ﬁle that is being renamed). Even if the master loses\\ncommunication with a primary, it can safely grant a new\\nlease to another replica after the old lease expires.\\nIn Figure 2, we illustrate this process by following the\\ncontrol ﬂow of a write through these numbered steps.\\n1. The client asks the master which chunkserver holds\\nthe current lease for the chunkand the locations of\\nthe other replicas. If no one has a lease, the master\\ngrants one to a replica it chooses (not shown).\\n2. Themasterreplieswiththeidentityoftheprimaryand\\nthe locations of the other (secondary) replicas. The\\nclient caches this data for future mutations. It needs\\nto contact the master again only when the primary'),\n",

The client pushes the data to all the replicas. A client\\ncan do so in any order. Each chunkserver will store\\nthe data in an internal LRU buﬀer cache until the\\ndata is used or aged out. By decoupling the data ﬂow\\nfrom the control ﬂow, we can improve performance by\\nscheduling the expensive data ﬂow based on the net-\\nworktopology regardless of which chunk server is the\\nprimary. Section 3.2 discusses this further.\\n4. Once all the replicas have acknowledged receiving the\\ndata, the client sends a write request to the primary.\\nThe request identiﬁes the data pushed earlier to all of\\nthe replicas. The primary assigns consecutive serial\\nnumbers to all the mutations it receives, possibly from\\nmultiple clients, which provides the necessary serial-\\nization. It applies the mutation to its own local state\\nin serial number order.\\n5. The primary forwards the write request to all sec-\\nondary replicas. Each secondary replica applies mu-\\ntations in the same serial number order assigned by\\nthe primary.\\n6. The secondaries all reply to the primary indicating\\nthat they have completed the operation.\\n7. The primary replies to the client. Any errors encoun-\\ntered at any of the replicas are reported to the client.\\nIn case of errors, the write may have succeeded at the\\nprimary andanarbitrary subsetof thesecondary repli-\\ncas. (If it had failed at the primary, it would not\\nhave been assigned a serial number and forwarded.)\\nThe client request is considered to have failed, and the\\nmodiﬁed region is left in an inconsistent state. Our\\nclient code handles such errors by retrying the failed\\nmutation. It will make a few attempts at steps (3)\\nthrough (7) before falling backto a retry from the be-\\nginning of the write.\\nIf a write by the application is large or straddles a chunk\\nboundary, GFS client code breaks it down into multiple\\nwrite operations. They all follow the control ﬂow described\\nabove but may be interleaved with and overwritten by con-\\ncurrent operations from other clients. Therefore, the shared\\nﬁle region may end up containing fragments from diﬀerent\\nclients, although thereplicas will beidenticalbecause thein-\\ndividual operations are completed successfully in the same\\norder on all replicas. This leaves the ﬁle region in consistent\\nbut undeﬁned state as noted in Section 2.7.\\n3.2 Data Flow\\nWe decouple the ﬂow of data from the ﬂow of control to\\nuse the networkeﬃciently. While control ﬂows from the\\nclient to the primary and then to all secondaries, data is\\npushedlinearlyalongacarefullypickedchainofchunkservers\\nin a pipelined fashion. Our goals are to fully utilize each\\nmachine’s networkbandwidth, avoid networkbottleneck s\\nand high-latency links, and minimize the latency to push\\nthrough all the data.\\nTo fully utilize each machine’s networkbandwidth, the\\ndata is pushed linearly along a chain of chunkservers rather\\nthan distributed in some other topology (e.g., tree). Thus,\\neach machine’s full outbound bandwidth is used to trans-\\nfer the data as fast as possible rather than divided among\\nmultiple recipients.\\nTo avoid network bottlenecks and high-latency links (e.g.,\\ninter-switch links are often both) as much as possible, each\\nmachine forwards the data to the “closest” machine in the\\nnetworktopology that has not received it. Suppose the\\nclient is pushing data to chunkservers S1 through S4. It\\nsends the data to the closest chunkserver, say S1. S1 for-\\nwards it to the closest chunkserver S2 through S4 closest to\\nS1, say S2. Similarly, S2 forwards it to S3 or S4, whichever\\nis closer to S2, and so on. Our networktopology is simple\\nenough that “distances” can be accurately estimated from\\nIP addresses.\\nFinally, we minimize latency by pipelining the data trans-\\nfer overTCP connections. Oncea chunkserverreceives some\\ndata, it starts forwarding immediately. Pipelining is espe-\\ncially helpful to us because we use a switched networkwith\\nfull-duplex links. Sending the data immediately does not\\nreduce the receive rate. Without networkcongestion, the\\nideal elapsed time for transferringB bytes toR replicas is\\nB/T +RL where T is the networkthroughput andL is la-\\ntency to transfer bytes between two machines. Our network\\nlinks are typically 100 Mbps (T ), andL is far below 1 ms.\\nTherefore, 1 MB can ideally be distributed in about 80 ms.\\n3.3 Atomic Record Appends\\nGFS provides an atomic append operation calledrecord\\nappend. In a traditional write, the client speciﬁes the oﬀ-\\nset at which data is to be written. Concurrent writes to\\nthe same region are not serializable: the region may end up\\ncontaining data fragments from multiple clients. In a record\\nappend, however, the client speciﬁes only the data. GFS\\nappends it to the ﬁle at least once atomically (i.e., as one\\ncontinuous sequence of bytes) at an oﬀset of GFS’s choosing\\nand returns that oﬀset to the client. This is similar to writ-\\ning to a ﬁle opened inO\\nAPPEND mode in Unix without the\\nrace conditions when multiple writers do so concurrently.\\nRecord append is heavily used by our distributed applica-\\ntions in which many clients on diﬀerent machines append\\nto the same ﬁle concurrently. Clients would need addi-\\ntional complicated and expensive synchronization, for ex-\\nample through a distributed lockmanager, if they do so\\nwith traditional writes. In our workloads, such ﬁles often'),\n",

The client pushes the data to all replicas of the\\nlast chunkof the ﬁle Then, it sends its request to the pri-\\nmary. The primary checks to see if appending the record\\nto the current chunkwould cause the chunkto exceed the\\nmaximum size (64 MB). If so, it pads the chunkto the max-\\nimum size, tells secondaries to do the same, and replies to\\nthe client indicating that the operation should be retried\\non the next chunk. (Record append is restricted to be at\\nmost one-fourth of the maximum chunksize to k eep worst-\\ncase fragmentation at an acceptable level.) If the record\\nﬁts within the maximum size, which is the common case,\\nthe primary appends the data to its replica, tells the secon-\\ndaries to write the data at the exact oﬀset where it has, and\\nﬁnally replies success to the client.\\nIfarecord appendfails atanyreplica, theclient retriesthe\\noperation. As a result, replicas of the same chunkmay con-\\ntain diﬀerent data possibly including duplicates of the same\\nrecord in whole or in part. GFS does not guarantee that all\\nreplicas are bytewise identical. It only guarantees that the\\ndata is written at least once as an atomic unit. This prop-\\nerty follows readily from the simple observation that for the\\noperation toreport success, thedatamust havebeenwritten\\nat the same oﬀset on all replicas of some chunk. Further-\\nmore, after this, all replicas are at least as long as the end\\nof record and therefore any future record will be assigned a\\nhigher oﬀset or a diﬀerent chunkeven if a diﬀerent replica\\nlater becomes theprimary. Interms of ourconsistency guar-\\nantees, the regions in which successful record append opera-\\ntions have written their data are deﬁned (hence consistent),\\nwhereas intervening regions are inconsistent (hence unde-\\nﬁned). Our applications can deal with inconsistent regions\\nas we discussed in Section 2.7.2.\\n3.4 Snapshot\\nThe snapshot operation makes a copy of a ﬁle or a direc-\\ntory tree (the “source”) almost instantaneously, while min-\\nimizing any interruptions of ongoing mutations. Our users\\nuse it to quickly create branch copies of huge data sets (and\\noften copies of those copies, recursively), or to checkpoint\\nthe current state before experimenting with changes that\\ncan later be committed or rolled backeasily.\\nLike AFS[5], we use standardcopy-on-write techniquesto\\nimplement snapshots. When the master receives a snapshot\\nrequest, it ﬁrst revokes any outstanding leases on thechunks\\nin the ﬁles it is about to snapshot. This ensures that any\\nsubsequentwrites to these chunkswill require an interaction\\nwith the master to ﬁnd the lease holder. This will give the\\nmaster an opportunity to create a new copy of the chunk\\nﬁrst.\\nAfter the leases have been revoked or have expired, the\\nmaster logs the operation to disk. It then applies this log\\nrecord to its in-memory state by duplicating the metadata\\nfor the source ﬁle or directory tree. The newly created snap-\\nshot ﬁles point to the same chunks as the source ﬁles.\\nThe ﬁrst time a client wants to write to a chunkC after\\nthe snapshot operation, it sends a request to the master to\\nﬁnd the current lease holder. The master notices that the\\nreference count for chunkC is greater than one. It defers\\nreplying to the client request and instead picks a new chunk\\nhandle C’. It then asks each chunkserver that has a current\\nreplica of C to create a new chunkcalled C’. By creating\\nthe new chunkon the same chunk servers as the original, we\\nensure that the data can be copied locally, not over the net-\\nwork(our disk s are about three times as fast as our 100 Mb\\nEthernet links). From this point, request handling is no dif-\\nferent from that for any chunk: the master grants one of the\\nreplicas a lease on thenew chunkC’ and replies to theclient,\\nwhich can write the chunknormally, not knowing that it has\\njust been created from an existing chunk.\\n4. MASTER OPERATION\\nThe master executes all namespace operations. In addi-\\ntion, it manages chunkreplicas throughout the system: it\\nmakes placement decisions, creates new chunks and hence\\nreplicas, and coordinates various system-wide activities to\\nkeep chunks fully replicated, to balance load across all the\\nchunkservers, and to reclaim unused storage. We now dis-\\ncuss each of these topics.\\n4.1 Namespace Management and Locking\\nMany master operations can take a long time: for exam-\\nple, asnapshotoperationhastorevokechunkserverleases on\\nall chunkscoveredbythesnapshot. Wedo notwantto delay\\nother master operations while they are running. Therefore,\\nwe allow multiple operations to be active and use locks over\\nregions of the namespace to ensure proper serialization.\\nUnlike many traditional ﬁle systems, GFS does not have\\na per-directory data structure that lists all the ﬁles in that\\ndirectory. Nor does it support aliases for the same ﬁle or\\ndirectory (i.e, hard or symbolic links in Unix terms). GFS\\nlogically representsits namespaceas alookuptable mapping\\nfull pathnames to metadata. With preﬁx compression, this\\ntable can be eﬃciently represented in memory. Each node\\nin the namespace tree (either an absolute ﬁle name or an\\nabsolute directory name) has an associated read-write lock.\\nEach master operation acquires a set of locks before it\\nruns. Typically, if it involves/d1/d2/.../dn/leaf, it will\\nacquire read-locks on the directory names/d1, /d1/d2, ...,\\n/d1/d2/.../dn, and either a read lockor a write lockon the\\nfull pathname/d1/d2/.../dn/leaf.N o t et h a tleaf may be\\na ﬁle or directory depending on the operation.\\nWenowillustrate howthislockingmechanism can prevent\\naﬁ l e/home/user/foo from being created while/home/user\\nis being snapshotted to /save/user. The snapshot oper-\\na t i o na c q u i r e sr e a dl o c kso n/home and /save,a n dw r i t e\\nlocks on/home/user and /save/user. The ﬁle creation ac-\\nquires read locks on /home and /home/user,a n daw r i t e\\nlockon /home/user/foo. The two operations will be seri-\\nalized properly because they try to obtain conﬂicting locks\\non /home/user. File creation does not require a write lock\\non the parent directory because there is no “directory”, or\\ninode-like, data structure to be protected from modiﬁcation.\\nThe read lockon the name is suﬃcient to protect the parent\\ndirectory from deletion.\\nOne nice property of this locking scheme is that it allows\\nconcurrent mutations in the same directory. For example,\\nmultiple ﬁle creations can be executed concurrently in the\\nsame directory: each acquires a read lockon the directory\\nname and a write lockon the ﬁle name. The read lockon\\nthe directory name suﬃces to prevent the directory from\\nbeing deleted, renamed, or snapshotted. The write locks on'),\n",

It typically has hundreds of chunkservers spread across\\nmany machine racks. These chunkservers in turn may be\\naccessed from hundreds of clients from the same or diﬀerent\\nracks. Communication between two machines on diﬀerent\\nracks may cross one or more network switches. Addition-\\nally, bandwidth into or out of a rackmay be less than the\\naggregate bandwidth of all the machines within the rack.\\nMulti-level distribution presents a unique challenge to dis-\\ntribute data for scalability, reliability, and availability.\\nThe chunkreplica placement policy serves two purposes:\\nmaximizedatareliability andavailability, andmaximizenet-\\nworkbandwidth utilization. For both, it is not enough to\\nspread replicas across machines, which only guards against\\ndiskormachinefailures andfullyutilizeseachmachine’snet-\\nworkbandwidth. We must also spread chunkreplicas across\\nracks. This ensures that some replicas of a chunk will sur-\\nvive and remain available even if an entire rackis damaged\\nor oﬄine (for example, due to failure of a shared resource\\nlike a network switch or power circuit).

It considers several fac-\\ntors. (1)Wewant toplacenewreplicason chunkserverswith\\nbelow-average diskspace utilization. Over time this will\\nequalize diskutilization across chunkservers. (2) Wewant to\\nlimit the number of “recent” creations on each chunkserver.\\nAlthough creation itself is cheap, it reliably predicts immi-\\nnentheavywrite traﬃc because chunksare createdwhende-\\nmandedby writes, andin ourappend-once-read-manywork-\\nload they typically become practically read-only once they\\nhave been completely written. (3) As discussed above, we\\nwant to spread replicas of a chunkacross rack s.\\nThe master re-replicatesa chunkas soon as the number\\nof available replicas falls below a user-speciﬁed goal. This\\ncould happen for various reasons: a chunkserver becomes\\nunavailable, it reports that its replica may be corrupted, one\\nof its disks is disabled because of errors, or the replication\\ngoal is increased. Each chunkthat needs to be re-replicated\\nis prioritized based on several factors. One is how far it is\\nfrom its replication goal. For example, we give higher prior-\\nity to a chunkthat has lost two replicas than to a chunkthat\\nhas lost only one. In addition, we prefer to ﬁrst re-replicate\\nchunks for live ﬁles as opposed to chunks that belong to re-\\ncently deleted ﬁles (see Section 4.4). Finally, to minimize\\nthe impact of failures on running applications, we boost the\\npriority of any chunkthat is block ing client progress.\\nThe master picks the highest priority chunk and “clones”\\nit by instructing some chunkserver to copy the chunk data\\ndirectly from an existing valid replica. The new replica is\\nplaced with goals similar to those for creation: equalizing\\ndiskspace utilization, limiting active clone operations on\\nany single chunkserver, and spreading replicas across racks.\\nTo keep cloning traﬃc from overwhelming client traﬃc, the\\nmaster limits the numbers of active clone operations both\\nfor the cluster and for each chunkserver. Additionally, each\\nchunkserver limits the amount of bandwidth it spends on\\neach clone operation by throttling its read requests to the\\nsource chunkserver.\\nFinally, the masterrebalancesreplicas periodically: it ex-\\namines the current replica distribution and moves replicas\\nfor better diskspace and load balancing. Also through this\\nprocess, the master gradually ﬁlls up a new chunkserver\\nrather than instantly swamps it with new chunks and the\\nheavy write traﬃc that comes with them. The placement\\ncriteria for the new replica are similar to those discussed\\nabove. In addition, the master must also choose which ex-\\nisting replica to remove. In general, it prefers to remove\\nthose on chunkservers with below-average free space so as\\nto equalize diskspace usage.\\n4.4 Garbage Collection\\nAfter a ﬁle is deleted, GFS does not immediately reclaim\\nthe available physical storage. It does so only lazily during\\nregular garbage collection at both the ﬁle and chunklevels.\\nWe ﬁnd that this approach makes the system much simpler\\nand more reliable.\\n4.4.1 Mechanism\\nWhen a ﬁle is deleted by the application, the master logs\\nthe deletion immediately just like other changes. However\\ninstead of reclaiming resources immediately, the ﬁle is just\\nrenamed to a hidden name that includes the deletion times-\\ntamp. During the master’s regular scan of the ﬁle system\\nnamespace, it removes any such hidden ﬁles if they have ex-\\nisted for more than three days (the interval is conﬁgurable).\\nUntil then, the ﬁle can still be read under the new, special\\nname and can be undeleted by renaming it backto normal.\\nWhen the hidden ﬁle is removed from the namespace, its in-\\nmemory metadata is erased. This eﬀectively severs its links\\nto all its chunks.\\nIn a similar regular scan of the chunknamespace, the\\nmaster identiﬁes orphaned chunks (i.e., those not reachable\\nfrom any ﬁle) and erases the metadata for those chunks. In\\na HeartBeatmessage regularly exchanged with the master,\\neach chunkserver reports a subset of the chunks it has, and\\nthe master replies with the identity of all chunks that are no\\nlonger present in the master’s metadata. The chunkserver\\nis free to delete its replicas of such chunks.\\n4.4.2 Discussion\\nAlthough distributed garbage collection is a hard problem\\nthat demands complicated solutions in the context of pro-\\ngramming languages, it is quite simple in our case. We can\\neasily identify all references to chunks: they are in the ﬁle-\\nto-chunkmappings maintained exclusively by the master.\\nWe can also easily identify all the chunkreplicas: they are\\nLinuxﬁles underdesignateddirectories oneachchunkserver.\\nAny such replica not known to the master is “garbage.”'),\n",

First, it is\\nsimple and reliable in a large-scale distributed system where\\ncomponent failures are common. Chunkcreation may suc-\\nceed on some chunkservers but not others, leaving replicas\\nthat the master does not know exist. Replica deletion mes-\\nsages maybelost, and themaster hastoremembertoresend\\nthem across failures, both its own and the chunkserver’s.\\nGarbage collection provides a uniform and dependable way\\nto clean up any replicas not known to be useful. Second,\\nit merges storage reclamation into the regular background\\nactivities of the master, such as the regular scans of names-\\npaces and handshakes with chunkservers. Thus, it is done\\nin batches and the cost is amortized. Moreover, it is done\\nonly when the master is relatively free. The master can re-\\nspond more promptly to client requests that demand timely\\nattention. Third, the delay in reclaiming storage provides a\\nsafety net against accidental, irreversible deletion.\\nIn our experience, the main disadvantage is that the delay\\nsometimes hinders user eﬀort to ﬁne tune usage when stor-\\nage is tight. Applications that repeatedly create and delete\\ntemporary ﬁles may not be able to reuse the storage right\\naway. We address these issues by expediting storage recla-\\nmation if a deleted ﬁle is explicitly deleted again. We also\\nallow users to apply diﬀerent replication and reclamation\\npolicies to diﬀerent parts of the namespace. For example,\\nusers can specify that all the chunks in the ﬁles within some\\ndirectory tree are to be stored without replication, and any\\ndeleted ﬁles are immediately and irrevocably removed from\\nthe ﬁle system state.\\n4.5 Stale Replica Detection\\nChunkreplicas may become stale if a chunk server fails\\nand misses mutations to the chunkwhile it is down. For\\neach chunk, the master maintains achunk version number\\nto distinguish between up-to-date and stale replicas.\\nWhenever the master grants a new lease on a chunk, it\\nincreases the chunkversion number and informs the up-to-\\ndate replicas. The master and these replicas all record the\\nnew version number in their persistent state. This occurs\\nbefore any client is notiﬁed and therefore before it can start\\nwriting to the chunk. If another replica is currently unavail-\\nable, its chunkversion number will not be advanced. The\\nmaster will detect that this chunkserver has a stale replica\\nwhen the chunkserver restarts and reports its set of chunks\\nand their associated version numbers. If the master sees a\\nversion number greater than the one in its records, the mas-\\nter assumes that it failed when granting the lease and so\\ntakes the higher version to be up-to-date.\\nThe master removes stale replicas in its regular garbage\\ncollection. Before that, it eﬀectively considers a stale replica\\nnot to exist at all when it replies to client requests for chunk\\ninformation. As another safeguard, the master includes\\nthe chunkversion number when it informs clients which\\nchunkserver holds a lease on a chunk or when it instructs\\na chunkserver to read the chunk from another chunkserver\\nin a cloning operation. The client or the chunkserververiﬁes\\nthe version number when it performs the operation so that\\nit is always accessing up-to-date data.\\n5. FAULT TOLERANCE AND DIAGNOSIS\\nOne of our greatest challenges in designing the system is\\ndealing with frequent component failures. The quality and\\nquantity of components together make these problems more\\nthe norm than the exception: we cannot completely trust\\nthe machines, nor can we completely trust the disks. Com-\\nponentfailures can result inan unavailablesystem or, worse,\\ncorrupted data. We discuss how we meet these challenges\\nandthetools wehavebuilt intothesystemtodiagnose prob-\\nlems when they inevitably occur.\\n5.1 High Availability\\nAmong hundreds of servers in a GFS cluster, some are\\nbound to be unavailable at any given time. We keep the\\noverall system highly available with two simple yet eﬀective\\nstrategies: fast recovery and replication.\\n5.1.1 Fast Recovery\\nBoth the master and the chunkserver are designed to re-\\nstore their state and start in seconds no matter how they\\nterminated. In fact, we do not distinguish between normal\\nand abnormal termination; servers are routinely shut down\\njust by killing the process. Clients and other servers experi-\\nence a minor hiccup as they time out on their outstanding\\nrequests, reconnect to the restarted server, and retry. Sec-\\ntion 6.2.2 reports observed startup times.\\n5.1.2 Chunk Replication\\nAs discussed earlier, each chunkis replicated on multiple\\nchunkservers on diﬀerent racks. Users can specify diﬀerent\\nreplication levels for diﬀerent parts of the ﬁle namespace.\\nThe default is three. The master clones existing replicas as\\nneeded to keep each chunk fully replicated as chunkservers\\ngo oﬄine or detectcorruptedreplicas throughchecksumver-\\niﬁcation (see Section 5.2). Although replication has served\\nus well, we are exploring other forms of cross-server redun-\\ndancysuchasparityorerasurecodesforourincreasing read-\\nonly storage requirements. We expect that it is challenging\\nbut manageable to implement these more complicated re-\\ndundancy schemes in our very loosely coupled system be-\\ncause our traﬃc is dominated by appends and reads rather\\nthan small random writes.\\n5.1.3 Master Replication\\nThe master state is replicated for reliability. Its operation\\nlog and checkpoints are replicated on multiple machines. A\\nmutation to the state is considered committed only after\\nits log record has been ﬂushed to disklocally and on all\\nmaster replicas. For simplicity, one master process remains\\nin charge of all mutations as well as background activities\\nsuch as garbage collection that change thesystem internally.\\nWhen it fails, it can restart almost instantly. If its machine\\nor diskfails, monitoring infrastructure outside GFS starts a\\nnew master process elsewhere with the replicated operation\\nlog. Clients use only the canonical name of the master (e.g.\\ngfs-test), which is a DNS alias that can be changed if the\\nmaster is relocated to another machine.\\nMoreover, “shadow” masters provide read-only access to\\nthe ﬁle system even when theprimary master is down. They\\nare shadows, not mirrors, in that they may lag the primary\\nslightly, typically fractions of a second. They enhance read\\navailability for ﬁles that are not being actively mutated or\\napplications that do not mind getting slightly stale results.\\nIn fact, since ﬁle content is read from chunkservers, appli-\\ncations do not observe stale ﬁle content. What could be'),\n",

It depends on the primary master only for replica\\nlocation updates resulting from the primary’s decisions to\\ncreate and delete replicas.\\n5.2 Data Integrity\\nEachchunkserveruseschecksummingtodetectcorruption\\nofstoreddata. GiventhataGFSclusteroftenhasthousands\\nof disks on hundreds of machines, it regularly experiences\\ndiskfailures that cause data corruption or loss on both the\\nread and write paths. (See Section 7 for one cause.) We\\ncan recover from corruption using other chunkreplicas, but\\nit would be impractical to detect corruption by comparing\\nreplicas across chunkservers. Moreover, divergent replicas\\nmay be legal: the semantics of GFS mutations, in particular\\natomic record append as discussed earlier, does not guar-\\nantee identical replicas. Therefore, each chunkserver must\\nindependently verify the integrity of its own copy by main-\\ntaining checksums.\\nAchunkis brokenupinto64 KBblocks. Each hasacorre-\\nsponding 32 bit checksum. Like other metadata, checksums\\nare kept in memory and stored persistently with logging,\\nseparate from user data.\\nFor reads, the chunkserver veriﬁes the checksum of data\\nblocks that overlap the read range before returning any data\\nto the requester, whether a client or another chunkserver.\\nTherefore chunkservers will not propagate corruptions to\\nother machines. If a blockdoes not match the recorded\\nchecksum, the chunkserver returns an error to the requestor\\nand reports the mismatch to the master. In response, the\\nrequestor will read from other replicas, while the master\\nwill clone the chunkfrom another replica. After a valid new\\nreplica is in place, the master instructs the chunkserver that\\nreported the mismatch to delete its replica.\\nChecksumming has little eﬀect on read performance for\\nseveral reasons. Since most of our reads span at least a\\nfew blocks, we need to read and checksum only a relatively\\nsmall amount of extra data for veriﬁcation. GFS client code\\nfurther reduces this overhead by trying to align reads at\\nchecksum block boundaries. Moreover, checksum lookups\\nand comparison on the chunkserver are done without any\\nI/O, and checksum calculation can often be overlapped with\\nI/Os.\\nChecksum computation is heavily optimized for writes\\nthat append to the end of a chunk(as opposed to writes\\nthat overwrite existing data) because they are dominant in\\nour workloads. We just incrementally update the check-\\nsum for the last partial checksum block, and compute new\\nchecksums for any brand new checksum blocks ﬁlled by the\\nappend. Even if the last partial checksum block is already\\ncorrupted and we fail to detect it now, the new checksum\\nvalue will not match thestored data, and thecorruption will\\nbe detected as usual when the blockis next read.\\nIn contrast, if a write overwrites an existing range of the\\nchunk, we must read and verify the ﬁrst and last blocks of\\nthe range being overwritten, then perform the write, and\\nﬁnally compute and record the new checksums. If we do\\nnot verify the ﬁrst and last blocks before overwriting them\\npartially, thenewchecksumsmayhidecorruptionthatexists\\nin the regions not being overwritten.\\nDuring idle periods, chunkservers can scan and verify the\\ncontents of inactive chunks. This allows us to detect corrup-\\ntion in chunks that are rarely read. Once the corruption is\\ndetected, the master can create a new uncorrupted replica\\nand delete the corrupted replica. This prevents an inactive\\nbut corrupted chunkreplica from fooling the master into\\nthinking that it has enough valid replicas of a chunk.\\n5.3 Diagnostic Tools\\nExtensive and detailed diagnostic logging has helped im-\\nmeasurably in problem isolation, debugging, and perfor-\\nmance analysis, while incurring only a minimal cost. With-\\nout logs, it is hard to understand transient, non-repeatable\\ninteractions between machines. GFS servers generate di-\\nagnostic logs that record many signiﬁcant events (such as\\nchunkservers going up and down) and all RPC requests and\\nreplies. These diagnostic logs can be freely deleted without\\naﬀecting the correctness of the system. However, we try to\\nkeep these logs around as far as space permits.\\nThe RPC logs include the exact requests and responses\\nsent on the wire, except for the ﬁle data being read or writ-\\nten. By matching requests with replies and collating RPC\\nrecords on diﬀerent machines, we can reconstruct the en-\\ntire interaction history to diagnose a problem. The logs also\\nserve as traces for load testing and performance analysis.\\nThe performance impact of logging is minimal (and far\\noutweighed by the beneﬁts) because these logs are written\\nsequentially and asynchronously. The most recent events\\nare also kept in memory and available for continuous online\\nmonitoring.\\n6. MEASUREMENTS\\nInthissection wepresent afewmicro-benchmarkstoillus-\\ntrate the bottlenecks inherent in the GFS architecture and\\nimplementation, and also some numbers from real clusters\\nin use at Google.\\n6.1 Micro-benchmarks\\nWe measured performance on a GFS cluster consisting\\nof one master, two master replicas, 16 chunkservers, and\\n16 clients.

All 19 GFS server machines are connected to one\\nswitch, and all 16 client machines to the other. The two\\nswitches are connected with a 1 Gbps link.\\n6.1.1 Reads\\nN clients read simultaneously from the ﬁle system. Each\\nclient reads a randomly selected 4 MB region from a 320 GB\\nﬁle set. This is repeated 256 times so that each client ends\\nup reading 1 GB of data. The chunkservers taken together\\nhave only 32 GB of memory, so we expect at most a 10% hit\\nrate in the Linux buﬀer cache. Our results should be close\\nto cold cache results.'),\n",

Virtually all ﬁles are replicated\\nthree times. Therefore, the clusters store 18 TB and 52 TB\\nof ﬁle data respectively.\\nThe two clusters have similar numbers of ﬁles, though B\\nhas a larger proportion of dead ﬁles, namely ﬁles which were\\ndeleted or replaced by a new version but whose storage have\\nnot yet been reclaimed. It also has more chunks because its\\nﬁles tend to be larger.\\n6.2.2 Metadata\\nThe chunkservers in aggregate store tens of GBs of meta-\\ndata, mostly the checksums for 64 KB blocks of user data.\\nThe only other metadata kept at the chunkservers is the\\nchunkversion number discussed in Section 4.5.\\nThe metadata kept at the master is much smaller, only\\ntens of MBs, or about 100 bytes per ﬁle on average. This\\nagrees with our assumption that the size of the master’s\\nmemory does not limit the system’s capacity in practice.\\nMost of the per-ﬁle metadata is the ﬁle names stored in a\\npreﬁx-compressed form. Other metadata includes ﬁle own-\\nership and permissions, mapping from ﬁles to chunks, and\\neach chunk’s current version. In addition, for each chunkwe\\nstore the current replica locations and a reference count for\\nimplementing copy-on-write.\\nEach individualserver, bothchunkserversandthe master,\\nhas only 50 to 100 MB of metadata.

Both clusters were in the middle of heavy\\nread activity. In particular, A had been sustaining a read\\nrate of 580 MB/s for the preceding week. Its network con-\\nﬁguration can support 750 MB/s, so it was using its re-\\nsources eﬃciently. Cluster B can support peakread rates of\\n1300 MB/s, but its applications were using just 380 MB/s.\\n6.2.4 Master Load\\nTable 3 also shows that the rate of operations sent to the\\nmaster was around 200 to 500 operations per second. The\\nmaster can easily keep up with this rate, and therefore is\\nnot a bottleneckfor these work loads.\\nIn an earlier version of GFS, the master was occasionally\\na bottleneckfor some work loads. It spent most of its time\\nsequentially scanning through large directories (which con-\\ntained hundreds of thousands of ﬁles) looking for particular\\nﬁles. We have since changed the master data structures to\\nallow eﬃcient binary searches through the namespace. It\\ncan now easily support many thousands of ﬁle accesses per\\nsecond. If necessary, we could speed it up further by placing\\nname lookup caches in front of the namespace data struc-\\ntures.\\n6.2.5 Recovery Time\\nAfter a chunkserver fails, some chunks will become under-\\nreplicated and must be cloned to restore their replication\\nlevels. The time it takes to restore all such chunks depends\\non the amount of resources. In one experiment, we killed a\\nsingle chunkserver in cluster B. The chunkserver had about\\n15,000 chunks containing 600 GB of data. To limit the im-\\npactonrunningapplications andprovideleeway forschedul-\\ning decisions, our default parameters limit this cluster to\\n91 concurrent clonings (40% of the number of chunkservers)\\nwhere each clone operation is allowed to consume at most\\n6.25 MB/s (50 Mbps). All chunkswere restored in 23.2 min-\\nutes, at an eﬀective replication rate of 440 MB/s.\\nIn another experiment, we killed two chunkservers each\\nwithroughly16,000chunksand660GBofdata. Thisdouble\\nfailure reduced 266 chunks to having a single replica. These\\n266 chunks were cloned at a higher priority, and were all\\nrestored to at least 2x replication within 2 minutes, thus\\nputting the cluster in a state where it could tolerate another\\nchunkserver failure without data loss.\\n6.3 Workload Breakdown\\nIn this section, we present a detailed breakdown of the\\nworkloads on two GFS clusters comparable but not identi-\\ncal to those in Section 6.2. Cluster X is for research and\\ndevelopment while cluster Y is for production data process-\\ning.\\n6.3.1 Methodology and Caveats\\nThese results include only client originated requests so\\nthat they reﬂect the workload generated by our applications\\nfor the ﬁle system as a whole. They do not include inter-\\nserver requests to carry out client requests or internal back-\\nground activities, such as forwarded writes or rebalancing.\\nStatistics on I/O operations are based on information\\nheuristically reconstructed from actual RPC requests logged\\nby GFS servers. For example, GFS client code may breaka\\nread into multiple RPCs to increase parallelism, from which\\nwe infer the original read. Since our access patterns are\\nhighly stylized, we expect any error to be in the noise. Ex-\\nplicit logging by applications might have provided slightly\\nmore accurate data, but it is logistically impossible to re-\\ncompile and restart thousands of running clients to do so\\nand cumbersome to collect the results from as many ma-\\nchines.\\nOne should be careful not to overly generalize from our\\nworkload.

Read\\nsizes exhibit a bimodal distribution. The small reads (un-\\nder 64 KB) come from seek-intensive clients that look up\\nsmall pieces of data within huge ﬁles. The large reads (over\\n512 KB) come from long sequential reads through entire\\nﬁles.\\nA signiﬁcant numberof reads returnno data at all in clus-\\nter Y. Our applications, especially those in the production\\nsystems, often use ﬁles as producer-consumer queues. Pro-\\nducers append concurrently to a ﬁle while a consumer reads\\nthe end of ﬁle. Occasionally, no data is returned when the\\nconsumer outpaces the producers. Cluster X shows this less\\noften because it is usually used for short-lived data analysis\\ntasks rather than long-lived distributed applications.\\nWrite sizes also exhibit a bimodal distribution. The large\\nwrites (over 256 KB) typically result from signiﬁcant buﬀer-\\ning within the writers. Writers that buﬀer less data, check-\\npointorsynchronizemoreoften, orsimply generateless data\\naccount for the smaller writes (under 64 KB).\\nAs for record appends, cluster Y sees a much higher per-\\ncentage of large record appends than cluster X does because\\nour production systems, which use cluster Y, are more ag-\\ngressively tuned for GFS.\\nTable 5 shows the total amount of data transferred in op-\\nerations of various sizes. For all kinds of operations, the\\nlarger operations (over 256 KB) generally account for most\\nof the bytes transferred. Small reads (under 64 KB) do\\ntransfer a small but signiﬁcant portion of the read data be-\\ncause of the random seekwork load.\\n6.3.3 Appends versus Writes\\nRecord appends are heavily used especially in our pro-\\nduction systems. For cluster X, the ratio of writes to record\\nappends is 108:1 by bytes transferred and 8:1 by operation\\ncounts. For cluster Y, used by the production systems, the\\nratios are 3.7:1 and 2.5:1 respectively. Moreover, these ra-\\ntios suggest that for both clusters record appends tend to\\nbe larger than writes. For cluster X, however, the overall\\nusage of record append during the measured period is fairly\\nlow and so the results are likely skewed by one or two appli-\\ncations with particular buﬀer size choices.\\nAs expected, our data mutation workload is dominated\\nby appending rather than overwriting.

Most requests askfor chunklocations ( FindLo-\\ncation) for reads and lease holder information (FindLease-\\nLocker) for data mutations.\\nClusters X and Y see signiﬁcantly diﬀerent numbers of\\nDelete requests because cluster Y stores production data\\nsets that are regularly regenerated and replaced with newer\\nversions.

Over time, the usage evolved\\nto include research and development tasks. It started with\\nlittle support for things like permissions and quotas but now\\nincludes rudimentary forms of these. While production sys-\\ntems are well disciplined and controlled, users sometimes\\nare not. More infrastructure is required to keep users from\\ninterfering with one another.\\nSomeof our biggest problemswere diskand Linuxrelated.\\nMany of our disks claimed to the Linux driver that they\\nsupported a range of IDE protocol versions but in fact re-\\nspondedreliably onlytothemorerecentones. Sincethepro-\\ntocol versions are very similar, these drives mostly worked,\\nbut occasionally the mismatches would cause the drive and\\nthe kernel to disagree about the drive’s state. This would\\ncorrupt data silently due to problems in the kernel. This\\nproblem motivated our use of checksums to detect data cor-\\nruption, while concurrentlywe modiﬁed thekernelto handle\\nthese protocol mismatches.\\nEarlier we had some problems with Linux 2.2 kernels due\\nto the cost offsync(). Its cost is proportional to the size\\nof the ﬁle rather than the size of the modiﬁed portion. This\\nwas a problem for our large operation logs especially before\\nwe implemented checkpointing. We worked around this for\\na time by using synchronous writes and eventually migrated\\nto Linux 2.4.\\nAnother Linux problem was a single reader-writer lock\\nwhich any thread in an address space must hold when it\\npages in from disk(reader lock ) or modiﬁes the address\\nspace in an mmap() call (writer lock). We saw transient\\ntimeouts in our system under light load and looked hard for\\nresource bottlenecks or sporadic hardware failures. Even-\\ntually, we found that this single lockblock ed the primary\\nnetworkthread from mapping new data into memory while\\nthe diskthreads were paging in previously mapped data.\\nSince we are mainly limited by the networkinterface rather\\nthan by memory copy bandwidth, we worked around this by\\nreplacing mmap() with pread() at the cost of an extra copy.\\nDespiteoccasional problems, theavailabilityofLinuxcode\\nhas helped us time and again to explore and understand\\nsystem behavior. When appropriate, we improve the kernel\\nand share the changes with the open source community.\\n8. RELATED WORK\\nLike other large distributed ﬁle systems such as AFS [5],\\nGFS provides a location independent namespace which en-\\nables data to be moved transparently for load balance or\\nfault tolerance. UnlikeAFS,GFS spreads aﬁle’s dataacross\\nstorage servers in a way more akin to xFS [1] and Swift [3] in\\norder to deliver aggregate performance and increased fault\\ntolerance.\\nAs disks are relatively cheap and replication is simpler\\nthan more sophisticated RAID [9] approaches, GFS cur-\\nrently uses only replication for redundancy and so consumes\\nmore raw storage than xFS or Swift.\\nIn contrast to systems like AFS, xFS,Frangipani [12], and\\nIntermezzo [6], GFS does not provide any caching below the\\nﬁle system interface. Our target workloads have little reuse\\nwithin a single application run because they either stream\\nthrough a large data set or randomly seekwithin it and read\\nsmall amounts of data each time.\\nSome distributed ﬁle systems like Frangipani, xFS, Min-\\nnesota’sGFS[11]andGPFS[10]removethecentralizedserver\\nand rely on distributed algorithms for consistency and man-\\nagement. We opt for the centralized approach in order to\\nsimplify the design, increase its reliability, and gain ﬂexibil-\\nity. In particular, a centralized master makes it much easier\\nto implement sophisticated chunkplacement andreplication\\npolicies since the master already has most of the relevant\\ninformation and controls how it changes. We address fault\\ntolerance by keeping the master state small and fully repli-\\ncated on other machines. Scalability and high availability\\n(for reads) are currently provided by our shadow master\\nmechanism. Updates to the master state are made persis-\\ntent by appending to a write-ahead log. Therefore we could\\nadapt a primary-copy scheme like the one in Harp [7] to pro-\\nvide high availability with stronger consistency guarantees\\nthan our current scheme.\\nWe are addressing a problem similar to Lustre [8] in terms\\nof delivering aggregate performance to a large number of\\nclients. However, we have simpliﬁed the problem signiﬁ-\\ncantly by focusing on the needs of our applications rather\\nthan building a POSIX-compliant ﬁle system. Additionally,\\nGFS assumes large number of unreliable components and so\\nfault tolerance is central to our design.\\nGFS most closely resembles the NASD architecture [4].\\nWhile the NASD architecture is based on network-attached\\ndiskdrives, GFS uses commodity machines as chunk servers,\\nas done in the NASD prototype. Unlike the NASD work,\\nourchunkserversuselazily allocated ﬁxed-sizechunksrather\\nthan variable-length objects. Additionally, GFS implements\\nfeatures such as rebalancing, replication, and recovery that\\nare required in a production environment.\\nUnlike Minnesota’s GFS and NASD, we do not seek to\\nalter the model of the storage device. We focus on ad-\\ndressing day-to-day data processing needs for complicated\\ndistributed systems with existing commodity components.\\nThe producer-consumer queues enabled by atomic record\\nappends address a similar problem as the distributed queues\\nin River [2]. While River uses memory-based queues dis-\\ntributed across machines and careful data ﬂow control, GFS\\nuses a persistent ﬁle that can be appended to concurrently\\nby many producers. The River model supports m-to-n dis-\\ntributedqueuesbutlacksthefaulttolerancethatcomeswith\\npersistent storage, while GFS only supports m-to-1 queues\\neﬃciently. Multiple consumers can read the same ﬁle, but\\nthey must coordinate to partition the incoming load.\\n9. CONCLUSIONS\\nThe Google File System demonstrates the qualities es-\\nsential for supporting large-scale data processing workloads\\non commodity hardware. While some design decisions are\\nspeciﬁc to our unique setting, many may apply to data pro-\\ncessing tasks of a similar magnitude and cost consciousness.\\nWestarted byreexamining traditional ﬁlesystem assump-\\ntions in light of our current and anticipated application\\nworkloads and technological environment. Our observations\\nhave led to radically diﬀerent points in the design space.\\nWe treat component failures as the norm rather than the\\nexception, optimize for huge ﬁles that are mostly appended\\nto (perhaps concurrently) and then read (usually sequen-\\ntially), and both extend and relax the standard ﬁle system\\ninterface to improve the overall system.\\nOur system provides fault tolerance by constant moni-\\ntoring, replicating crucial data, and fast and automatic re-\\ncovery.

GFS servers generate di-\\nagnostic logs that record many signiﬁcant events (such as\\nchunkservers going up and down) and all RPC requests and\\nreplies. These diagnostic logs can be freely deleted without\\naﬀecting the correctness of the system. However, we try to\\nkeep these logs around as far as space permits.\\nThe RPC logs include the exact requests and responses\\nsent on the wire, except for the ﬁle data being read or writ-\\nten. By matching requests with replies and collating RPC\\nrecords on diﬀerent machines, we can reconstruct the en-\\ntire interaction history to diagnose a problem. The logs also\\nserve as traces for load testing and performance analysis.\\nThe performance impact of logging is minimal (and far'),\n",
